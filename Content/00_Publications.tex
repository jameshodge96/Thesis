\textbf{Contribution statement:} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Chapter four} - The two studies covered in this chapter were peer-reviewed and published at the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems \citep{hodge_exploring_2018,hodge_exploring_2019}. Both papers were co-authored by Dr. Kellie Morrissey and Sandra Hastings, with additional co-authorship from Dr Madeline Balaam for the 2018 paper, and Dr Kyle Montague for the 2019 paper. While this chapter expands on the data that was not used for either publications, I acknowledge that ideas and arguments in the chapter are influenced by the publications. Furthermore, the concluding sections of this chapter acts as a set of design decisions that are described in a published book chapter for 'HCI and Design in the Context of Dementia \citep{hodge2020sharing} that I co-authored with Dr Kellie Morrissey who provided feedback on the paper's writing and contribution. 

    \item \textbf{Chapter five} - The study covered in this chapter is currently being peer-reviewed in the TOCHI journal. The paper is co-authored by Dr. Sarah Foley, Dr. Daniel Lambton-Howard, Dr. Kyle Montague, Dr. Laura Booi, Sandra Hastings, Prof. David Kirk, and Dr. Kellie Morrissey. I was responsible for concept, study design, data collection, data analysis and writing of the paper. Co-authors supported the facilitation of the hackathon, and Dr. Kellie Morrissey, Dr. Sarah Foley and Dr. David Kirk provided feedback on the paper's writing and contribution.
    
    \item \textbf{Chapter six} - A version of this chapter was published at CHI'20 \citep{hodge_relational_2020} with collaboration from  Dr. Sarah Foley, Dr. Rens Brankaert, Dr. Gail Kenning, Dr. Amanda Lazar, Dr. Jennifer Boger, and Dr. Kellie Morrissey. In this study, I was responsible for methodology, organising data collection, data analysis, leading the study, and writing the paper. Several of the authors contributed to conducting the interviews which I analysed. While I directed the study, the paper is highly collaborative and it must be acknowledged that many of the authors influenced the ideas and arguments of the paper.

    \item \textbf{Chapter seven} - While the work in chapter seven has yet to be published, Dr. Kellie Morrissey and Prof. David Kirk supported this chapter. I was responsible for concept, study design, data collection, data analysis and writing of the paper. Co-authors supported the final part of the analysis and provided feedback on study design.
