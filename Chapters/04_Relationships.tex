\chapter{Sharing a virtual world with people with dementia: A reflective account}
\label{NegotatingReseacherParticipantRelationships}

\section{Introduction}
\label{CH4:Intro}
In the previous two chapters, I introduced literature relevant to dementia and HCI that underpins this work. Following, the methodology chapter highlights the ways researchers have tailored participation to suit the needs of people with dementia. As I mention in the reflexivity section in the previous chapter, this chapter is a reflective account that presents the \textit{``influence the researcher has on what is being studied and, simultaneously, of how the research process affects the researcher''} \citep{probst2014double}. Keeping a reflective journal has been helpful in the learning process of moving from a computer science background, to now identifying as a qualitative user researcher. A significant part of this chapter reflects on the ethical dilemmas when working within these sensitive settings. In turn, the chapter works to frame the motivations for the subsequent studies. With this in mind, this account examines the following two studies: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item  \textbf{Study one: Tailored virtual reality environments}: Designing Virtual Reality (VR) experiences have become a growing interest in HCI with recreational VR applications coming to the market. However, consideration for how these experiences may be designed for people with dementia to provide both comfort and enrichment has rarely been explored. In the first study, I work closely with seven participants with dementia to design VR experiences of their choosing. In this section, I discuss how I designed the VR experiences with the participants, and conclude with opportunities and drawbacks of how I conducted the research.
    
    \item \textbf{Study two: Media capture of meaningful experiences}: Following study one, the second study aimed to explore the opportunities and challenges of designing personalised multimedia experiences with people with dementia and their families. The previous research focused on the concept of reminiscence, by developing the environments after the workshops. In this second study, the experiences of being in the moment are most important, and I aimed for the families to capture and ‘design’ the experiences themselves using 360-degree cameras. I worked with three families: two married couples, both with a wife living with dementia, and where the husbands had formed a close relationship through attending a support group. The third family was a family of four, where the father was living with dementia. The families took part in day trips, which they co-planned, with data collection duration during these days providing insights into their shared social experiences. Following this, workshops were also held to personalise the experience of media created during these days out. Further, I describe building a set of moment boxes that resonate with the data collected. I conclude this section by reflecting on the limitations of participation; designing for 'in the moment'; and the difficulties of introducing technology within sensitive design contexts.
\end{itemize}

\section{Study one: Tailored virtual reality environments}
\label{StudyOne}
In November 2016, I started my final undergraduate year in the School of Computing at Newcastle University. Given my interests in  HCI and developing technology around dementia, the Head of School assigned my project to Dr Madeline Balaam and Dr Kellie Morrissey, who have similar interests in health and dementia. Given my family history with dementia, I was interested in exploring how technology could improve people's lives with dementia. My Grandpa was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in his early 50’s, and my Grandma took care of him until he passed away when he was 67 (2001). I wanted to know more about the neurodegenerative condition and understand what my Grandpa and Grandma went through. 

At the time, virtual reality (VR) was gaining attention through the popularity of VR headsets and being picked up by the entertainment industry, particularly the gaming industry \citep{cipriani_understanding_2014}. When looking at the uses of VR for people with dementia, it was surprising to see a focus on neurological rehabilitation \citep{schultheis_application_2001,mendez2015virtual}. For instance, \citep{garcia2012discussion} proposed VR to offer brain-stimulating activities to reduce the progression of dementia. While this work is promising in their domains, at the time, prior work did not consider how VR could function as an expressive and creative medium for people with dementia.

As such, by focusing on the growing body of work that has concentrated toward evoking emotion \citep{wallace_design-led_2013}, and creativity through technology with people with dementia, this study aimed to consider how VR environments for people with dementia might be sensitively designed to provide comfortable and enriching experiences. As I describe in the methodology, Sandra from Silverline Memories expressed interest in the design of a VR app on AppMovement where she describes the app as providing \textit{``images and scenes which could stimulate memory as well as providing comfort and reassurance to people with dementia or any memory loss''} (see figure \ref{fig:AppMovement-Sandra} for AppMovement quote). With Silverline Memories residing in the outskirts of Newcastle, my supervisors reached out to see if I could run a series of workshops at their dementia café as part of their afternoon tea sessions on Mondays. Dementia Cafés are places where people with dementia, their families, and friends can come along and be part of a supportive environment that encourages opportunities for sharing experiences. These workshops had been organised to be flexible to co-exist alongside other organised activities within the dementia café. The aim was to get to know the members of Silverline Memories, and from getting to know one another, I could then curate a set of tailored VR environments that would be interesting for the café.

\subsection{Workshop one: Getting to know the participants}
\label{StudyOne:W1}

\end{subfigure}
\caption{Silverline memories community room (taken from Silverline Memories Facebook)}
\label{fig:SilverlineCommunityRoom}
\end{figure}

For the first workshop, I wanted to find out what type of environments the members at Silverline Memories might want from a virtual reality experience. Working alongside Dr Kellie Morrissey, we set out to Silverline Memories dementia café, and I felt nervous. I felt so out of place. Apart from my experience with my Grandpa when I was a child, I had never really been around people with dementia. Kellie and I arrived at the dementia café a little earlier than Sandra. Sandra came later than us with bags full of snacks and drinks for the members. As we approached the dementia café. We helped Sandra carry the bags into the the cafe (seen in fig \ref{fig:SilverlineCommunityRoom}). On the left side of the room was a kitchen area for volunteers to hand out tea, coffee and biscuits throughout the session, which had an open plan for volunteers and members to help themselves freely. 

As I helped Sandra set up the room, I got my notebook out, VR headset, a recorder, and consent/information sheets. As the first couple entered the café, Sandra and the other volunteers came over to them with open arms. They caught up, got them a cuppa tea and biscuits, and sat down. Sandra introduced the couple, Philip and Kate, who seemed enthusiastic to talk to us. They asked about the research, and what we did. However, as I would find out later on, the initial few minutes of signing consent, reading information sheets, and explaining the research are uncomfortable for all those involved. At that moment, it went from an informal conversation into a formal study where two of us would be analysing and studying what was said. As we described the study, both were very happy to participate in the conversation about the types of VR experiences they would like to see. They were okay with quotes being used as long as they were anonymised.

With VR being relatively new to the members, I began by introducing a simple VR experience which consisted of being placed in a virtual apartment as participants tried on a Google Cardboard headset. The decision for an apartment VR experience was decided for its neutral nature; it did not give any low or high expectations for what to expect with VR technology. After participants tried the headset, we spoke about the type of places they would like to see through the VR headset. I used printouts of images to further these conversations, such as images of libraries, museums, forests, and beaches. During the first workshop, I spoke for an extended time with one couple, Thomas and Janet, where Janet was living with advanced dementia and struggled with verbal communication. Thomas told me about Janet's preferences for a VR environment that emphasised country music. From this, I decided to create a personalised VR experience based on her love for Shania Twain. I also set out to design and develop two environments for the dementia café. The first was a beach environment, and the second was a park that took inspiration from a local park that participants had reminisced about in the workshop.

The workshop was my first experience working with people with dementia, but more importantly, the first time I would be seen as a `researcher'. Although I looked young and got sarcastic comments from the participants about my age, I did not know how to conduct myself in conversations with this new title. Each conversation felt like an interview, and I sensed a power imbalance. In some instances, power imbalance came from both sides, with members of Silverline Memories having been a part of the café for some time. Members did not have to talk to us or participate in the study, and if they did not, they had nothing to lose.

On the other hand, Kellie and I were the only ones walking around with the title of `researcher' who were here to interview and record participants. It was so unnatural to me, but why would it be natural? I do not start my conversations with friends or family with consent forms and placing an audio recorder on the table. Nevertheless, the methodologies I was told to follow focused on the importance of researcher-participant relationships. For instance, \cite{mckillop2004make} highlight the importance of building relationships with people with dementia to make participants feel more comfortable in the study. The authors provide several strategies to improve engagement in interviews, such as talking about the person's life and what they have done today; being empathetic and caring in the interviews; and being flexible in the conversation to fit the participant's needs.

\subsection{Designing Tailored VR environments}
\label{S1:VREnvrionments}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{Images/ChapterFour/IrishCastlVR.png}
\caption{Park environment including an Irish castle}
\label{fig:IrishCastle}
\end{figure}

From the data collected from the first workshop, I created sketches based on individuals' ideas and desires. While I could not develop each participant's individual experience due to time constraints, some ideas were combined into one environment. For example, from my field notes, one participant asked to \textit{`take [her] back to Ireland, to see the beautiful castles again’}. While I could not do that, I did create 3D designs of a traditional castle from Irish medieval architecture. We placed it in the park environment that many participants expressed interest in (see Fig.\ref{fig:IrishCastle}).

I created all three VR environments in the Unity game engine. I carefully planned the design of our environments in terms of the participant's field of view. I applied \cite{alger_visual_2015} concept of content zones (Fig.\ref{fig:ContentZone}) to reduce risks of sickness or disorientation and to improve the overall experience for the individuals. At the time, designing realistic VR experiences was limited to using 360-degree cameras. As I wanted to create experiences that may not be available, such as a 360-degree Shania Twain concert, the design of the environment was based on low-poly art that not only can run on low-end hardware (a simple smartphone) but which also provides a very stylised and abstract view of the reality.

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{Images/ChapterFour/ContentZones.png}
\caption{Content zones in VR}
\label{fig:ContentZone}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Workshop two: ``Lighthouse, Rocks, Sand, Sea, Boat!''}
\label{StudyOne:WorkshopTwo}
In the second workshop, I returned to Silverline Memories to try out the different environments focused on the group at large: the beach with a horse running along the sand and a park based on a local park nearby, Jesmond Dene. Given that the charity had recently won a lottery fund, the volunteers provided celebration activities such as a magician and a singer. The celebrations put less pressure on me, as the entertainers kept the room occupied while I gradually went around the room and showed the VR environments to attendees. 

Multiple care partners and people with dementia tried the park and beach experiences and adored them. With encouragement from her daughter, Lucy, living with dementia, tried the beach experience and started listing what she could see — \textit{``lighthouse, rocks, sand, sea, boat!''} — as she rotated around and took control of the experience by focusing on the parts of the environment she found interesting. In this instance, Lucy was not a passive observer in the experience, but in fact, the focal point driving the experience. Lucy continued to talk about the experience to her daughter, which added to a shared experience for the two. In this way, the technology acted as a novel experience that provided an excuse or conduit for conversation - similar to `ticket to talk'. \cite{welsh_ticket_2018} discusses, in their design of Ticket to Talk, an app to provide conversational guidance in dementia, that carefully designed technology can provide essential conduits for a social chat in dementia when social partners are unsure what to talk about. By tailoring the VR environments to the participant's interests, often, participants would comment on identifiable objects or reference memories associated with the beach or the park.

They are not the only couple who found the opportunity to share meaningful experiences. Many, if not all participants, expressed a wish to be able to share the same live VR experience as their partner or parent. When asked about this, participants indicated that meaningful shared experiences with their loved ones with dementia had changed recently or decreased in frequency. For example, Linda, whose husband Michael is living with dementia, mentioned that the couple no longer drive and had to use public transport. This meant that the two could not visit favoured locations together, and so indicated that the VR park and beach could be used to supplement their recreational activities and allow them to experience a semblance of the sorts of activities that used to mean very much to them. Having the carers experience the environment first allowed carers to help direct their loved ones around the environment by being able to probe specific interactions in the environment that the person living with dementia may have missed. For instance, one carer started asking questions about what they could see or if they saw the horse walk past on the beach. 

Near the end of the workshop, I sat down with Thomas and Janet to show them their personalised Shania Twain concert hall. With the current room getting quite loud, I asked the couple to sit down in the back room at the dementia café as a significant part of the experience was linked to the music itself. As I set the VR headset and passed it over to Janet, Thomas expressed some initial concerns about Janet having ‘the patience to hold the [headset] for a long time’. Thomas initially aided her in holding the VR headset:

\begin{quote}
\textit{Straight away [Janet] started to sing. She was singing to the tune and attempted to repeat the lyrics… [and] changed her body language completely. It went from rather static, to movements that captured the tempo of the music. Janet held up her hands to try to hold the Google Cardboard as well, which indicated she did not want to stop the experience. [Afterwards], she seemed very happy and just from being around her, you could see her mood had changed completely.}    
\end{quote}

While Janet’s experience was heightened by her ability to recall the Shania Twain song, she got to experience it in a completely new way. While her verbal abilities are limited, other means of communicating became apparent. Janet’s interests, body movement, and overall socialness in the café significantly changed after experiencing the concert hall. The bespoke design that placed Janet at the forefront of the design, and who could drive the experience, has a freeing effect that is pleasurable for participants who can engage in enjoying activities; lately, reflecting on the experience, Thomas mentions that Janet has \textit{``always sang and whistled. She can sing along to songs as long as she remembers the words. The aesthetic of the theatre was a great idea and gave a great sense of space''}.

\subsection{Reflections and outcomes}
\label{S1:ReflectionsOutcomes}
I embarked on this study with interest in learning more about dementia that I have family ties with. During the conducting of the study described above, I was able to have multiple conversations about dementia with my Grandma and understand her relationship with dementia. Through these conversations, I was able to connect to my Grandpa, who I never thought I would have the chance to. Listening to my Grandma's stories of looking after my Grandpa painted a picture of a relationship with 'ups and downs', with an overall positive perspective of dementia. However, only by spending more time at Silverline Memories did I gain a more in-depth understanding of the vastly different experiences people have with dementia. To conclude this section, I reflect on the following three areas:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Designing beyond reminiscence.
    \item Challenges of designing technology.
    \item Participant involvement in the design process.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Designing beyond reminiscence}
\label{ReminiscencevsMoment}
During the first workshop, participants expressed particular locations that resonated with their childhood. For example, several participants who grew up in Newcastle described seeing Jesmond Dene Park or Whitley Bay Beach - with both places being popular days out' places in the North East. During the converastions, participants would often describe structural details such as \textit{``I love the bridges over the lake''}, and stories of Whitley Bay lighthouse. Those not from Newcastle expressed other childhood memories and locations, such as one participant asking to \textit{``take [her] back to Ireland, to see the beautiful castles again''}. Drawing on childhood memories mirrors the use of technology to support the collection of media such as photos, texts, or other memorable artefacts, from the person with dementia's past \citep{astell_stimulating_2010}. The media can then be used for conversation, reminiscence, and interaction between the person with dementia and family care partners and care staff. As such, one of the key insights in this work was the wish for shared experiences and the potential for VR experiences to promote conversation. 

While prior work, including my own, has leveraged techniques such as reminiscence, I believe in some instances that this can limit the active participation of the person with dementia in these design processes. While reminiscence can provide opportunities for engagement \citep{gowans_designing_2004, yasuda_effectiveness_2009}, for some, it may merely be non-engaging or cause frustration when not being able to remember a specific memory from their past \citep{lazar_using_2014}. Further, centring an activity around the stability of long-term memory can lead to distress and raised expectations for the person with dementia who may not connect with the activity meaningfully. While Janet had a clear connection with Shania Twain, which supported the overall enjoyment of the experience, the experience might have been disinteresting or frustrating to both Janet and Thomas if Janet had not recognised the music. In contrast, other work that aims to provide a failure-free environment has been exemplified by systems such as CIRCA \citep{alm_communication_2007}. The CIRCA technology consists of a touch screen that displays music, video, photos and text to support general reminiscence rather than targetting specific life experiences or relationships.

Therefore, researchers must question whether approaches that rely on the person’s ability to recognise or articulate past events are an appropriate activity to enhance emotional connection. Similarly, researchers might also ask how we could provide opportunities for people to interact with evocative immersive experiences with differing emotional valence. It could be that they are not necessarily ‘pleasant’ memories, but are not distressing, and are valid and important experiences with which it may be valuable to interact.

\subsubsection{Challenges of designing technology}
\label{S1:Robustness}
With the study being exploratory work that consists of two workshops, there was not enough time to develop a robust product that could stay with Silverline Memories. At the time, I knew that the three environments I made were very rough prototypes that were prone to breaking and very limited to working on my phone device. Knowing the condition these prototypes were in, I never thought they would be ready to be deployed and used without my assistance to set up and solve unexpected software crashes. \cite{hwang2020exploring} further discourages leaving technology that might be in the prototype stages. If the technology evokes \textit{``frustration, anxiety or sense of vulnerability''}, the person with dementia might resist the technology altogether. This resonates with \cite{vines_our_2017}, who describes participants' frustrations with using Google Glass, which stopped supporting the product resulting in an outdated product with bugs typically found in prototypes. 

Additionally, \cite{hwang2020exploring} stresses the importance of care partners' and volunteers' training, configuring and supporting the person with dementia in using technology. Similarly, in this study, care partners demonstrated this role in encouraging the use of virtual reality and asking questions about what the participant could see in the virtual environment. In this way, the leaving of technology requires more robust working products and upskill care partners or volunteers to know how to use the technology and support the learning process of accessing the VR environments. 

\subsubsection{Participant involvement in the design process}
\label{WhatExtentCo-design}
As described in the background literature and methodology, several researchers have innovated many of the methodological approaches to support people living with dementia to engage meaningfully in the design and development of technology \citep{hendriks_challenges_2014, wallace_enabling_2012-1,lazar_critical_2017}. For this study, although I did not have sufficient time with the participants to make a truly co-designed process, I spent more time with Thomas and Janet to inform the building of the Shania Twain concert hall. In part, this was opportunistic from Sandra expressing interest on behalf of Thomas, who could see the potential value of VR for people with dementia. During the first workshop, Thomas and I talked at length about the potential of VR and how Janet may use it. This led to talking about Janet's favourite songs and how he curates Youtube playlists at home. By the end of the conversation, I had expressed interest to Thomas in building a concert hall around Janet's favourite musical experiences.

While we had generated an idea together for the VR environment based on Janet's interests, that was the extent to which people with dementia were involved in the generative process. In workshop two, people with dementia were involved in the evaluative stages to understand how people with dementia might use VR and the potential issues with current VR technology. Rather than the work being co-design, the process was more towards a consultation of the types of interesting experiences people with dementia might need. Further, given Janet would rarely speak, Thomas spoke on her behalf and indicated the type of interests she might want. While this worked well in this instance, this raises several questions: To what extent can people with dementia contribute to design of technology? If so, are people with dementia acting as an equal part in the discussion, or rather, engaging in a set of workshop activities that provide the opportunity to co-create? \citep{tsekleves2020engaging}

\section{Study two: Media capture of meaningful experiences}
\label{studyTwo}
Motivated by the outcomes of the previous study, the following study explored the role of rich, personalised media experiences as a support for families with dementia. Taking account of the ecology of care of the person with dementia, which considers the person with dementia, friends, and family, the experiences I created in this study needed to be meaningful to the family — not just the person with dementia. 

Working with Silverline Memories again, I carried out a Research Through Design (RTD) methodology. RTD is a way of doing research which is the practice of design used to address wicked problems \citep{zimmerman_research_2007}, which entail a sense of complexity, and which have no current solution. I worked with three families: two married couples, both with a wife living with dementia, and where the husbands had formed a close relationship through attending a support group. The third family was a family of four, where the father was living with dementia. The three families took part in day trips, which they co-planned, with data collection during these days providing insights into their shared social experiences. Workshops were also held  in order to personalise the experience of the media created during these days out. One output of RTD is the creation of artefacts, which resulted in the creation of 'moment boxes' for the families to keep and use after the study. To respond to the reflections above, this study set out to tackle the reflections by:



\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Designing beyond reminiscence}: Instead of relying on the person's abilities to recognise or articulate past events, this study orients experiences towards being in the moment and living a meaningful life with dementia.

    \item \textbf{Challenges of designing technology}: While this study focuses on building prototypes to explore the ways technology might be used by people with dementia, an output of this work is for the families to be provided with a VR headset and additional materials made post the end of the study.

    \item \textbf{Participant involvement in the design process}: In the first study, participants had little input on what would be created for the VR environments. This was primarily due to the short turnaround of the project. For this project, I worked with the families over numerous visits and co-designed days out to leverage the walking interview technique described in the methodology.
\end{itemize}

To begin conversations with families about participating in the project, I met the families at one of the Silverline Memories days out. I used this as an opportunity to get to know the families, explain the research and purpose. Sandra introduced the two married couples (Lauren, Michael, Sarah and John), who seemed somewhat sceptical of participating. Initially, Michael jokingly would ask if I would be \textit{``spying on them''}, or how I \textit{``look awfully young to be a researcher''}. These jokes distinctly made me stand out from the rest of the group. There was a clear divide between who I was and their community. At the time, I felt like I had to prove that I was invested in what they had to say, and I was not here just to collect data and then leave. 

Similar to the reflective piece in the methodology, Michael asked \textit{``why are you so interested in us?''} I told Michael stories about my Grandparent's relationship and how I wanted to know how technology could improve the quality of life for families with dementia. This led to Michael  opening up about the importance of relationships and friendship when Lauren was diagnosed with dementia:

\begin{quote}
\textit{``It's been a few years since Lauren was diagnosed with dementia, and Silverline Memories has been a lifeline for us. At first, I didn't know what to really do... We would just sit inside all day and Lauren would just look at the wall and not do anything. But then a friend of mine started to tell me to start going to these dementia activity days like Silverline, and that is where I met John and Sarah. Since then, it has been life-changing. We go on holidays, spend most of our weekdays together, and try to do as much as possible.''
}    
\end{quote}

It was apparent how meaningful the relationship was between Lauren, Michael, Sarah and John. From Sarah and Lauren's diagnosis, the four of them depended on one another, not just for enjoyment, but for Michael and John to depend on one another for support. As we continued to talk and spent the day getting to know the couples, Michael and John both ended up being very keen on taking part in the research. I sat down with the four of them, and we planned out a day out at a National Trust park in Northumberland. I took their phone numbers, and we scheduled the rest of the day out over the phone.

\subsection{Day out with `The Fabulous Four'}
\label{DayOutOne}

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Images/ChapterFour/FamilyDayOut.png}
\caption{The Fabulous Four day out}
\label{fig:DayOut}
\end{figure}

For the first day out, I went out on a day out with John, Sarah, Lauren and Michael - also known at Silverline Memories as 'The Fabulous Four'. The families decided on the National Trust Site in Northumberland as this was a place that Michael and Lauren had become fond of over the past decade. As travelling can cause discomfort to many, I hired the driver (Dave) from Silverline Memories, who not only gave comfort to the families as he was a familiar face, he acted as a tour guide, which the families appreciated and found his presence to be enjoyable. The family directed our day to capture moments they would like to experience again through personalised media. I captured these moments using photography, audio-recordings, as well as more contemporary technologies such as 360-degree video cameras. On the day out, I spent time with the family as more than just an observer. I took part in activities set out by the families, engaged in conversations and helped with capturing specific moments the families wanted throughout the day. The day out captured insights into each family’s history, the families’ care for the person with dementia, and meaningful interactions between the family members.

The day started by sitting down at Michael's and Lauren's home, where the group suggested we meet. The pre-day-out conversation was relatively straightforward, reiterating the study and filling out consent forms. Once consent was filled in, Dave, the driver, drove the group to Wallington National Trust. Once at the site, I encouraged the family to decide where to walk through the day, including when they wanted to return home and if they wanted to sit down and have lunch or a rest. For capturing 360-degree videos and photography, the family would direct me around the day. For instance, John would suggest \textit{``Hey, can we go to the Chinese Pond and you could capture some videos of us walking through the place?''} Throughout the day, the interview process had an open-ended style and had the characteristics of a conversation rather than an interview. During the day, I would often lead the conversations by following up on the participant's comments about the day, or reacting to their nonverbal (i.e. picking up some bark on the floor through the forest).

\subsection{The families active role in the day out}
\label{ActiveRole}

Throughout the day out, interactions with the family seemed radically different from previous conversations. Having a continuous activity seemed to stimulate the sharing of knowledge between everyone involved. This section introduces three interactions with the couples, which shaped my understanding of walking interviews and allowed me to get to know the families.


\subsubsection{Taking lead}
\begin{quote}
\textit{   \textbf{Lauren}: ``You take note because I forget which way I come from, where I'm going to.''
}\end{quote}

\begin{quote}    
\textit{    \textbf{Researcher}: ``Don't worry. No problem. If we get lost, we'll get lost together. That's fine. It's so beautiful. You've been here quite a few times. Is that right?''
}    \end{quote}
    \begin{quote}    

\textit{    \textbf{Lauren}: ``Yes. Yes.''
}\end{quote}

Early on, Lauren expressed moments of anxiety regarding her orientation on the walk. Initially, she felt she could not take the lead and would rather depend on someone else on the day out instead. Gradually over the day, Lauren became confident in chatting about hobbies, interests, and directing me towards areas she found interesting such as showing me certain flowers she found pretty and miniature figurines found in the Wallington House.

Once Lauren gained confidence on the day-out, the walking interview format offered her to regulate our conversations by choosing different topics and having breaks together by sitting down at a nearby bench or slowing down. Lauren brought up topics relating to nature and the day out, which often led to Lauren asking me about what I do for work or wanting to look at the photos and videos that I had taken from the day. This was in stark contrast to how Lauren would never initiate a conversation with me in more traditional sit-down interviews. One reason for this, was that the walking interviews provided opportunities for one-to-one conversation away from Michael, her husband, who would typically speak on behalf of Lauren. As such, the opportunity to walk alongside the participants made for a much more participatory, comfortable and supportive experience that suited the necessary needs of the person with dementia.

\subsubsection{Carers sharing family stories}
Halfway through the day, the group stumbled across a set of folding chairs in the middle of the walled gardens. Sarah and Lauren suggested for us to sit down. As we did, Michael started to share a drinking and hunting tale from his past, which focuses on his own inchoate experiences, not those experiences solely with Lauren:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Michael}:\textit{    ``We ended up in a little village called Farnworth. And in Farnworth there's a stream that runs through it. There is a road bridge, and underneath the road bridge, there is a deep place where you can get your horse in and you can wash all its legs off and get all of the mud off the bottom of it. Then . . . [a lady] went right under, which of course was hilarious to some of us who were still slightly uninhibited. But I can see the whole thing in my mind. It was just a fun day. It's all down to 150\% whiskey spirit.''
}\end{quote}

Over the day, I found myself getting many opportunities to get to know the carers as much as the people with dementia. Traditionally studies often separate carers and people living with dementia as previous work expected different needs from one another. When carers are designed for/with, technologies typically focus on duties of care with direction toward assistive technology \citep{bennett_assistive_2017, gibson2015everyday}. Spending time with Michael and John, I started to understand the types of interests and desires they might want for the media experiences I eventually implemented into the moment boxes. In this way, the walking interviews offered insight into moments away from caring possibilities and dementia. Instead, Michael and John shared who they are rather than being defined by their roles. 

\subsubsection{collaborative storytelling}
\label{CollabStorytelling}
In the house at Wallington National Trust, one room, in particular, caught Sarah and Lauren's attention. This room was filled with carefully modelled miniature figurines that both admired for a lengthy amount of time. During our time admiring these model houses and figurines, the interactions between the group could be seen as collaborative storytelling:
\begin{quote}
   \textit{\textbf{ Sarah}: ``Oh wow, look at how lovely these are!''
   *pointing at the minitaure figurine set*}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
    \textit{\textbf{James}:  Imagine having one of these to play with when you were younger}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\textit{    \textbf{Sarah}: ``Oh I know. It is incredible! Look at these little ones here'' *prompting me and Lauren to have a look*}

\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\textit{    \textbf{Lauren}: ``Ah they're lovely aren't they''
}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\textit{    \textbf{John}: ``You had something like that when younger Sarah didn't you?''
}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\textit{    \textbf{Sarah}: ``Absolutely. its fantastic!''
}
\end{quote}

Continuing from the quote above, Sarah and John jointly shared the telling of Sarah's interests as a child. Although Sarah had difficulties in finding the exact words for describing her childhood miniature home, John supported the storytelling by structuring the story by asking Sarah questions he knew she could follow and answer. In this way, Sarah was able to keep her active role in telling her childhood stories.


\subsection{Day out with the Clark family - challenges with consent}
\label{ClarkFamily}
For the second day out, I invited the Clark family who expressed interest in going to Seahouses - a beach that held a place in the family's history. The family consists of Kate, her husband, Philip, who has advanced dementia, and their two daughters. On the day out, I met the group at their home and sat them all down to go over the initial consent and information sheet. Philip, who was rarely verbal, and could no longer read or write, was finding it challenging to consent. Despite having his two daughters and wife to assist in the decision making, we could not provide an agreement to take part in the study at that very moment. 

Regardless of not being able to record or take part in the research, I still took the family on the day out as the trip had been planned, and the sole purpose was to provide an enjoyable day out for the family. Throughout the day, Philip's interest in spending time with myself and his family became more apparent, and by the end of the evening, Philip started to take part in group conversations, tickle his daughters' necks, and say to his partner, \textit{``I love you''}. His family had rarely seen these acts from Philip over the past year. Since my interactions with the family, I've been continuously frustrated with following rigid ethical procedures. Following the University's procedures, consent could only be signed at the start of the project. As \cite{dewing_participatory_2007} describe, traditional methods have often excluded the person with dementia by using a spouse or care partner to provide consent, and the consent process would never be revisited throughout the study. Instead, Dewing and others suggest a model where consent processes are a continuing consideration throughout the research project to provide informed flexibility and involvement from people with dementia \citep{dewing_participatory_2007,slaughter2007consent,mckeown_actively_2009}.

This model consists of a strong understanding of the person with dementia to ensure the researcher can recognise the participants changing consent and assent over time. \cite{haraldsdottir2019relational} describe the process \textit{``highlights the ability for people to express choice and respond to experiential encounters and situations that remain long after cognitive decision making is reduced below the legal threshold for informed consent''} \citep[pg. 4]{haraldsdottir2019relational}. As such, the process of consent is highly flexible and situational. However, in contrast, when submitting the ethical procedures to the University Ethical Review board, it was relatively static and required to follow their set rules. While the ethical review board at the University is in place to protect participants and the research, If I could have sought support, advice, and had a more open collaboration through the ethical process, perhaps Philip's involvement in the research could have changed radically.

\subsection{Workshops}
\label{workshops}
Having captured a wide variety of data on the days out, I wanted to create ideas of how this data could be personalised and be used by the families. I invited families, designers, and dementia experts to individual family workshops to consolidate the personalisation and to store the created moments from their days out. In the workshop, I shared pictures and VR videos to give each participant a perspective of the day out and to see the digital moments that the families had co-created. The first workshop activity was for participants to create and share a salient memory from their past. The families were prompted to think of the context, the sensory stimulation, others involved in that memory, and then finally to share the memory with the group. The discussion then focused on how memories such as these could be translated into technological media in order to be able to relive or experience that memory in tandem with others. To structure this discussion of unfamiliar technological interactions, participants used an adapted version of Tiles IoT toolkit \citep{mora2017tiles}. Through the collection of the data from the days out, and the workshops, the following sections describe the ways the data influenced the design of the moment boxes.


\section{Developing a design rationale for the Moment boxes}
\label{DesignRationale}
This section drawing from the analysis seen in this paper, details the design rationale that informs the building of the moment boxes. 

\subsection{Tactile and tangible}
\label{DR:TactileTangible}
As mentioned in previous literature and in particular, \cite{nolan_perceptions_2006} work on stigma, people living with dementia have reported a feeling of lack of confidence when going out and building new relationships. Through our conversations, Michael describes Lauren's social engagement at dementia coffee morning is radically different when she attends along:

\begin{quote}
\textit{    ``I`m told that she participates, and that she is much better when I am not there than she is when I’m there . . . Very often she has got her hand on Kym’s walker (a friend), walking her down as though she is looking after her and helping her.''
}
\end{quote}

To allow for coherent continuation of Lauren’s sense of self, the moment boxes require tangible and sharable activiites that Lauren could use with others outside of her relationship with Michael. As Lauren has a close relationship with Sarah and others from the dementia-friendly communities she is a part of, the media experiences must encourage shared, meaningful interactions. While this may seem like we are ignoring Michael’s needs, we are instead respecting the whole spectrum of relationships that individuals have within the ecology of care is important. Working from the insights, I note the following design needs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The moment box requires an attractive design and to be easily transportable for the families to share with others.
    \item To have different physical objects that can be touched or played with while watching the media experiences between two or more people. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Providing choice}
\label{DR:ProvidingChoice}
From early on, I aimed to design the media experiences with not only the person living with dementia, but to include their family members and friends. Traditionally, studies often separate carers and people living with dementia as previous work expected different needs from one another. When carers are designed for/with, technologies typically have a focus on duties of care with direction towards assistive technology (Bennett et al., 2017; Bharucha et al., 2009; Gibson et al., 2015). Spending time with the ecology of care, and with a focus on memorable and pleasurable activities, the overall technology or activity tends to instead include a variety of interests and interactions that the ecology of care desire. With many carers reporting high levels of burnout and burden (Takai et al., 2009), targeting carers as research participants worthy of digital interventions focusing on personhood (as much as we target those with dementia) means treating them with respect, and as whole persons, rather than defining them by their roles.

In the workshops, Michael expressed wanting to share experiences that would place Lauren in experiences that required to articulate past events as their history held significant importance to him. However, as I got to know Lauren through the study, it was apparent that Lauren lacks recognition of memories and may become frustrated. For this reason, the media experiences need to provide the opportunity for care partners to express their experiences through recognition, and if their spouse chooses to do so, they can join the experience too. In response, the media experiences need to consider the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The experiences must consider the different interests of the family members as well as the person with dementia. 
    \item To provide opportunities that could do not rely on recognition of past memories.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Nurture caring relationships}
\label{CaringRelationships}
In the study, the participating families were aware that our intentions were to design media experiences not only for the person with dementia, but for family members too. Through this approach, support in and through relationships for the carer, outside of the care-giver, care-receiver pair, was as important for us as design researchers as the relationships for the person with dementia. For instance, while Sarah and John were interested in, and excited for, sharing experiences with the different forms of media, the couple focused more on the day out itself when talking to me in the workshop. 

Further, it was apparent how supportive Lauren and Sarah's relationship was for being engaged throughout the day. In a conversation with Michael, he recalled their family holiday with Sarah and John, and Michael mentioned that Lauren and Sarah \textit{"walked up the seafront hand in hand all the time, chatting away. What they talk about, one never knows"}. In this way, seeing the way Lauren and Sarah support one another, I realised that the parts of the media experiences I would be creating should focus on their relationships solely, including intimate moments between the two showing friendship and respect for one another, acknowledging the other's dementia and increased need for care. With this in mind, the moment box requires the following design needs:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Design multiple ways to interact with the different data the family curated on the days out.
    \item The moment box needs to consider the different relationships between the couples, i.e. Sarah and Laurens's relationship.
\end{itemize}


\section{Moment boxes}
\label{MomentBoxes}

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{Images/ChapterFour/MomentBoxespng.png}
\caption{Moment box}
\label{fig:MomentBoxes}
\end{figure}

Based on the data collection and analysis seen in my 2019 CHI paper \citep{hodge_exploring_2019}, I created each family a moment box to support families to revisit their captured moments from the days out. In this section, I describe the individual components of the moment box that considers the different interests and desires of the family members and the person with dementia. Each moment box came with an Oculus Go Virtual Reality headset, a personalised wooden picture box, and a bamboo wooden box filled with physical objects from the days out, or specific requests from the participants such as the dioramas. The moment boxes are split into the following: a) VR tour, b) bamboo box, and c) picture box.

\subsection{VR Tour}
\label{VRTour}

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{Images/ChapterFour/WalktrhoughOfWallington.png}
\caption{Walkthrough experience of Wallington Trust}
\label{fig:wallingtonTrust}
\end{figure}

Participants wanted to explore the day out through the captured 360-degree videos. To do this, I designed a ‘walkthrough’ experience where the user could navigate different areas of their day by clicking on pink circles on the video within the VR headset (see figure \ref{fig:wallingtonTrust}). For example, clicking ‘Walk to the Chinese Pond’ from the entrance video will take you to the Chinese Pond video. By capturing the footage with a 360-degree video, exploring the tour allows the user to freely choose what they want to focus on. For instance, in figure \ref{fig:capturedFootage}, the user using VR can either look towards their left to explore the flowers in the walled garden, or reminisce about the day by looking at the right by following the family walk through the park. This means that for some, the moments are less about revisiting the past, and instead foster emotional connections of the beautiful scenery in the video. 

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{Images/ChapterFour/WaysToViewCapturedFootage.png}
\caption{Different ways to view the captured footage}
\label{fig:capturedFootage}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Bamboo Box}
\label{Bamboo box}

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.6\linewidth]{Images/ChapterFour/originalDesign.png}
\caption{Sketch of the original moment box with handle}
\label{fig:oldDesign}
\end{figure}
Family members also expressed the types of material for the moment boxes. Through a couple of iterations and engagement with family members, bamboo was decided to be light and sturdy for the box. While this limited the customisability of the cardboard boxes, they remained sturdier and would last longer. In one of the workshops, Kate shared \textit{``Philip likes to pick at things or pull at corners of card. . . I think the boxes would have to be wooden or made out of something more solid so it can last longer''}. With more time, I could have created a more personalised box with a custom-made handle and lock on the sides to make the item more portable. Still, given the time frame and overdue handing the boxes over to the families, I had to sacrifice particular design decisions (figure \ref{fig:oldDesign} shows an earlier design with a handle and lighter build). The bamboo box splits into two smaller boxes that consist of a) dioramas, b) storage for the QR code moments. I describe these below:

\subsubsection{Dioramas}
\label{Dioramas}

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}

  \label{fig:DiroamaTwo}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Dioramas created for Lauren and Sarah}
\label{fig:Dioramas}
\end{figure}

Throughout getting to know the participants with dementia, they expressed a range of interest in playful tangible objects that they could hold, feel and smell. For instance, Sarah would pull bark off the trees to play with as we walked through the forest. Further, as described earlier, Lauren and Sarah seemed fascinated by the miniature figurines and homes on their day out. With this in mind, the top-tier section of the moment box is a set of personalised dioramas. For each family, the dioramas are inspired by the days-out. While the one on in figure \ref{fig:Dioramas} represents the Wallington National Trust Chinese Pond, they are designed in a way to remain abstract enough to be enjoyed by others. 

\subsubsection{QR Code moment}
\label{QR-Code-Moments}

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}

  \label{fig:QRCode}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{QR codes VR activity}
\label{fig:QRcodes}
\end{figure}
Lauren and Sarah expressed how they wanted to share some of the captured experiences with others at Silverline Memories. As the two of them had little interest in taking the headset with them, the way to access the 360-degree videos required to be lightweight and easy to use. In the bottom section of the bamboo box, is a set of QR codes that once scanned, opens up a random moment that the family captured on the day out. To provide easy instructions for the volunteers and people with dementia, the user places the QR code into the square (shown in figure \ref{fig:QRcodes}), and follows the instructions on the side. I decided to make the QR codes laser cut to give them a tactile feel where users could share them around without being easily damaged. Further, given the potential challenges of choice-making as dementia progresses, the ambiguity of what each QR resembles removes the difficulty of anxiety of choosing on behalf of the others taking part in the activity.

Kate and Philip's daughters mentioned they would like to 360-degree video capture other family members as they thought recording more moments \textit{``would be a lovely thing to do''}. With the family expressing a wish to capture further meaningful moments, I design tutorial guides, assisting in creating 360-degree videos for their family gatherings. Upon capturing the moments, the family can place their videos on YouTube and generate QR codes (see figure \ref{fig:QRCode-Captured}), which can be used similarly to the above but with postcards instead. While time spent with the family can increase Philip’s meaningful interactions with the family, having a family archive of moments could also help to explore ways in which Philip can interact and experience familiar positive memories through hearing and seeing his much-loved family interact with one another.

\subsection{Picture box}

  \label{fig:AlbumBox}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Optional ways to access bespoke moments}
\label{fig:OptionalMoments}
\end{figure}

From the days out, all participants expressed an interest in the photos I was taking and expressed how lovely they looked. To ensure that the pictures wouldn't be put away in a drawer to be forgotten, I designed an album box to contain the images and a USB drive with all the data collected from the days out and workshops. The data was theirs to keep, and if they ever needed to print out multiples of the images, or use the videos and audio for other reasons, they had the data to do so. Additionally, Through Vimeo, I curated a showcase with an archive of all the videos taken from the days out (see figure \ref{fig:AlbumBox}). In the boxes, I printed out multiple small cards that families could share with others with a bit.ly link for others to watch the videos. 

\section{Reflections and outcomes}
\label{S2:Reflection}
Over these two studies, the work has indicated tensions that arise in working within sensitive settings. As the work moved toward appreciating the importance of being in the moment in dementia care, it became apparent that the initial starting point of using virtual reality was not the critical part of the research. A collective contribution from the last 20 years of research around dementia is that someone living with dementia can still experience meaningful interactions, relationships, and activities at almost all stages of the condition \citep{kitwood1997dementia}. But with over-protection, stigmatisation, and emphasising people’s lack of ability, many believe that people living with dementia are poor at social contact, which can then prohibit many from interacting with people living with dementia \citep{christine_bryden_dancing_2005, riley_anxiety_2014}. We all interact with the world differently. We communicate, experience, integrate ourselves differently from one another. Through relationships and learning from one another, we can move toward a more inclusive relationship and understanding of how our neighbours and communities can create meaning in their day-to-day experiences — regardless of their diagnosis. In this section, I reflect on the three areas I set out to tackle at the start of the study.

\subsection{Designing beyond reminiscence}
\label{beyond-reminiscence}
In the second study, it was clear that attempting to refer back to older memories may cause frustration or confusion. Michael describes that sometimes he struggles to orient Lauren to reality, creating new experiences of grief when she is told, time and again, that her mother has passed away. In contrast, Dana Walrath's graphic novel Aliceheimer's, about her relationship with her mother - Alice, who has Alzheimer's, conveys accepting her mother's reality and often going along with Alice's reality:

\begin{quote}
\textit{"[the graphics novel], shows how we treated Alice's hallucinations and disorientation as a special power. Instead of fighting about what was really there or where each of us was, we let her ability to travel through space and time peaceably account for our distinct realities. This made it possible for me to read the symbols buried in her travels. As I created the art, I used symbols such as cut text form Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland to make Alice's bathrobe, her favorite garment, to convey our magical approach to living with dementia" \citep{walrath2021aliceheimer,walrath2017end}}
\end{quote}

Orienting the person with dementia towards the `right' reality has very little effect; if the dementia is sufficiently progressed, the person will simply forget this reorientation again. It is also considered to be poor practice \citep{cipriani_understanding_2014}. It is imperative to remember that a sense of self can come from more than just our ability to recall and recount memories. Working with people with dementia sensitively should push us to reflect on the structural challenges of understanding the reality of the person living with dementia and designing for this often `dreamlike' state, depending on the stage of dementia \citep{bryden_before_2015}. With this in mind, researchers should consider what it means to design media experiences for realities that may eclipse each other briefly rather than conflict with each other entirely. In a similar vein,  although in the study, I indicated how outside activities can be captured via media, I must stress that this is no substitute for going outside, or for care homes to replace gardening or nature walks with virtual realities of the same. Actually engaging in such activities has multiple psychological and physiological benefits \citep{gilliard_transforming_2011} — researchers should instead begin to think about how both activities can overlap and eclipse each other: for instance, participants could collect rocks from beach walks — these are easily fitted with RFID tags which, when touched or otherwise triggered, lead to a change or simple interaction in the immersive environment.

\subsection{Challenges of designing technology}
\label{robust-tech}
When reflecting on the two studies, a critical distinction between the two is that study two provides the participants with the physical moment boxes to keep and use post the study. While building the moment boxes took considerably longer than I anticipated, due to other PhD commitments such as conferences, paper writing, and presentations, I delivered the moment boxes to the families about six months after the data collection. At first, I tried to contact Kate and Philip, but had no luck in reaching out to them. Later through Silverline Memories, I found out they were going through some family problems. For the other family, I met them at Michael's house, where I sat them down and walked through the moment boxes.

I placed the boxes between couples – one for Michael and Lauren and another for Sarah and John. They took the tops off the moment boxes, which revealed the personalised dioramas. Both said they \textit{``love it''} and started to feel and play with the grass and ducks in the ponds. After showing the album box with the photos from the days out, Michael asked, \textit{``What about the VR? I'm dying to try it''}. I took the VR headsets out, and we discussed how to set them up and what the headset can do. John and Michael grabbed the headsets and placed them on together. As I directed them through the range of settings, they both started to talk and interact with one another as they explored the 360 experiences:

\begin{quote}
\textit{    \textbf{John:} ``Here..Michael, are you seeing this? I see the house and you chatting to our James.'' *laughter*
}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textit{    \textbf{Michael}: ``Hang on a sec. . . I'm at the Ponds. Come to the ponds. How does he do that James?''
}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textit{    \textbf{James}: ``Flick the top button of the controller in your hand and you'll start moving between the different 360 videos.''
}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textit{   \textbf{ John}: ``Ah this is canny James.''
}
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textit{    \textbf{Michael}: ``Look at the little chickens.''}
\end{quote}
At the time, Sarah and Lauren didn't seem interested in the headsets. They were laughing at John and Michael's interactions alongside me. Michael and John had expressed earlier in the study that they had iPad's and would like to see the experiences using non-VR technology. I introduced the QR code activity and described it to the four. As Lauren and Sarah grabbed a random QR code, looking slightly unsure of what would happen, Michael and John scanned the code on their tablets and rotated their Ipad to move the 360 video. As the four continued to play with the moment boxes, I concluded the study and left.

A couple of weeks later, I had a brief call with John and Michael about their interactions with the moment boxes. Sarah and Lauren had spent very little time experiencing any of the VR experiences but would sometimes sit down and play with the dioramas, the photos, and the laser-cut QR codes. Sarah found the burnt lines in the plywood to create the QR code interesting to feel and hold. Michael and John felt guilty that what I had made wasn't being used as much. As we discussed that this would be the end of the study, both thanked me for all the work and said, \textit{``if you are ever doing this again. . . we'd be more than happy to go on another day out''}.

While the families were thankful, their comments suggested that VR wasn’t a technology they felt comfortable with or were wanting to explore anymore. If anything, the use of VR was driven by myself and Sandra at Silverline Memories. Instead, John mentioned how he and Sarah loved \textit{``being the centre of attention on the day out, and its been so lovely to get to know you James''}. In a way, the building of relationships between myself and the families was held at a higher significance than the moment boxes.

Throughout this process, learning how to tailor the moment boxes and virtual reality environments has been a long and complex process. It has taken a long time to build the relationships with participants who would then be willing to share their experiences. Not only that, in many cases, I had to learn new ways to adopt the methodologies better to suit the needs of the person with dementia. All of the lessons I have had to learn to work in such a complex space, were far from being covered in the Computer Science course.

Similarly, \cite{hendriks_valuing_2018} has been concerned by implications arising from design activities, and considered novel approaches to undergraduate education to provide budding designers and developers with the skillset and ethics to make more sensitive design choices. In the context of dementia and HCI, this has led to inviting students to collaborate in co-design methods with care home residents by developing life story work \citep{mckeown2015you} and storytelling projects \citep{hyden2013storytelling}. \cite{hendriks_valuing_2018} further supports the importance of designers and students building a relationship with the people we are designing for and with in the context of dementia. The authors argue design decisions \textit{``emerge from the relationships designers build''} \citep[pg. 3]{hendriks_valuing_2018}. However, while opportunities to work in more non-traditional settings such as care homes may be possible through university classes, these are often limited to a small, selected group of students or courses focusing on healthcare and psychology \citep{kinnunen_understanding_2018}, meaning those who are taught technical or design disciplines through university miss out on opportunities to gain experience with the vulnerable populations that they may end up building for. 

\subsection{Participant involvement in the design process}
\label{extent-co-design}

\cite{sanders2008co} states that end-users \textit{``plays a large role in knowledge development, idea generation and concept development''} and that users require the appropriate tools to express themselves and convey that they are the experts of their experiences \citep{visser2005contextmapping}. However, as described in the methodology chapter, participatory tools and approaches are not always appropriate for people with dementia. For instance, in my first study, the workshops did not provide Janet with many opportunities to share interests and desires for virtual reality. Instead, her care partner, John, provided insights into Janet's music interests and the potential use cases for VR for her. In contrast, by designing days out with families in study two, I was able to get to know the participants with dementia through other means that moved beyond verbal expressions. \cite{hyden2013storytelling} argues that embodied movement can go beyond verbal expression and is an interactive process to participate in storytelling. Further, participants had control over pace, direction and topics on the days out. In this way, walking around a location puts less strain on verbal communication than the expectation to participate that people with dementia might feel in a sit-down interview or workshop. 

However, despite the participant's involvement in co-design the days-out and the rich data collected informed by the participant's embodied experiences and sense of place, the extent to which participation can be described as co-design requires further consideration. From conducting these studies, they several ethical considerations that question the abilities of people with dementia to contribute meaningfully to the co-design process. For this section, I split this into: a)  difficulty in sharing ownership over the process, and b) limiting people with dementia in specific design stages.

First, keeping participants anonymous is standard ethical practice when working in sensitive settings. However, doing so, challenges the potential for people with dementia to share ownership and agency over the academic writing and process. In study two, Philip's participation was complicated because he could not consent in the manner the university's ethical review board set out. It was evident within these two studies that participant involvement in design is central to designing sensitive and meaningful experiences. However, when they are infrastructures and processes that restrict or limit the participant's involvement, \cite{hendriks_challenges_2014} argues that building an equal collaboration is challenging between the user and designers.

Second, as \cite{suijkerbuijk_active_2019} describes in her literature review on involving advanced stages of dementia in the design of assistive technology, the contribution that people with dementia have to the different phases of technology development varies. For instance, \cite{rodgers2015designing} describes a limited involvement of people with dementia in the design stage where the design team decides on the design brief, 'problem space' and the potential solution. Similarly, \cite{unbehaun_facilitating_2018} work with co-design exergames only involved caregivers and other stakeholders in the pre-design phase. This was because the phase can be deemed more challenging for people with dementia due to abstract and creative thinking. Both of the studies in this chapter focus on the generative phase of design, where new ideas are constructed by performing participatory activities. In hindsight, inviting people with dementia to the pre-design phase may have provided insights into technologies that the families would have been keen to adopt more than VR. While prior work does suggest the difficulties in promoting the voices of people with dementia in the pre-design phase, future work should consider how to create tools that promote conversation between designers and people with dementia in this stage. By inviting people with dementia at the early stages, we can ensure co-design processes and studies are rooted in participant-led agendas and provide a more ethical research impact.


\section{Summary}
\label{C4:Summary}
In this chapter, I provide a reflective account of two studies where I worked closely with people with dementia and their family members. The focus of the chapter is to shine a light on the implications of designing participatory activities within this space. Through these studies, I reflect on recognising the role of the researcher as essential in building and maintaining relationships, and as a means of conducting engaged and impactful research. However, as I highlight towards the end, this has required working closely with people with dementia to engage in open and exploratory design responses to their lived experiences which needed long-term upskilling and education within HCI and dementia. Coming from a Computer Science background, I missed many opportunities to gain experience in social settings that I might be building for as a developer or designer. In response, the following chapter examines how students, developers and designers approach such a complex topic with little to no training.

Additionally, the research extends from person-centred approaches, which rely on relational processes as the basis of design. Through co-designing days-out and tailoring VR and media experiences with families with dementia, these studies provide insights into ways to treat the person with dementia as an individual; working within ecologies of care; and acknowledging that dementia is a complex experience that often also includes social complexity, ageing and multi-morbidities, which require attuning to in design and research responses. As such, this chapter also raises numerous ethical complexities such as consent, relationships and ownership in the co-design process. In response to the lessons learned, the following two chapters examine (see figure \ref{fig:ChapterFour_FutureStudies}): a) designers'/developers' shifting sensitivities about dementia in a hackathon aimed to provide a space for upskilling attendees on HCI and dementia, and b) the types of ethical concerns HCI researchers face in the dementia context.
