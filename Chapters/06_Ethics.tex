\chapter{Learning from Ethics in Dementia Research}
\label{EthicsChapter}

\section{Introduction}
\label{Ethics:Intro}
In this chapter, I present insights into the ethical experiences and practices in the field of HCI and dementia, where I interviewed 22 researchers from diverse countries, institutions, and disciplines. As the previous chapters have explored the involvement of people with dementia, students (designers/developers), this chapter examines the insights strictly from the researchers perspective of their own cultivated practices. While exploring researchers concerns of participatory approaches in this line of work resonated in chapter four, many conversations I had with dementia researchers at HCI conferences sparked interest in collaborating on this particular project. 

A version of this chapter was published at CHI'20 \citep{hodge_relational_2020} with collaboration from  Dr. Sarah Foley, Dr. Rens Brankaert, Dr. Gail Kenning, Dr. Amanda Lazar, Dr. Jennifer Boger, and Dr. Kellie Morrissey. In this study, I was responsible for methodology, data collection, data analysis, leading the study, and writing the paper. While I directed the study, the paper is highly collaborative and it must be acknowledged that many of the authors influenced the ideas and arguments of the paper. With this in mind, I revisited the study and expanded the discussion section to a) fit with the thesis themes, and b) to ensure the contribution in the thesis is firmly my own.

My conversations with the paper's authors resonate with concurrent conversations predominantly occurring in venues such as Town Halls \citep{munteanu_sigchi_2019,bruckman_cscw_2017,frauenberger_research_2017} and conference workshops at ACMvenues \citep{waycott_ethical_2015,lazar_hcixdementia_2018}. A particular interest has arisen in working with participants in sensitive contexts, due to the unique challenges that arise due to what it means to participate when capacity is difficult to ascertain \citep{foley_printer_2019,lazar_using_2014}, in verbal processes for people who are often not verbal \citep{knapp_nonverbal_2013,kontos_integrating_2018,john_killick_claire_craig_creativity_2012}, and recognition of participants involvement throughout the study \citep{wallace_enabling_2012-1,lindsay_empathy_2012,morrissey_creative_2015}. To date, these conversations have helped share experiences that are often based on a single research project. Yet we are missing an understanding of how researchers in a diverse array of contexts handle ethical decisions. As an example of a topic that emerged in our paper through considering different viewpoints, Ethical Review Boards (ERBs) are in place to ensure research is following standard ethical principles, with the aim of protecting the participants, researchers and research institutions \citep{flicker_ethical_2007}. Despite playing a key role and coming up repeatedly in town halls in terms of questioning how the HCI community can think about ethics given the variation (or lack) of ERBs in the international context, there has been little research to date that examine the impact of ERBs on research in HCI. With this in mind, this chapter takes design ethics in dementia and HCI research as a study to reflect as a community of practice and to elucidate broader concerns about ethics in HCI research.

\section{Methodology}
\label{Ethics:Methodology}
Interested in the tacit and unstated practices that researchers employed in working with people with dementia and their carers, I undertook a reflective qualitative approach to carrying out this empiracal research. I invited 22 self-identified researchers and/or designers to one-to-one questions to elucidate wider concerns about ethics in HCI research. The following study tackles \textit{What are the ethical implications for people with dementia to participate in HCI research?}

\subsection{Participants and recruitment}
\label{Ethics:Participants}
I recruited 22 self-identified designers and/or researchers (12 women, 10 men). Each participants reported significant experience in working with people with dementia in the design of technologies and services. Participants demographics are summarised in table \ref{Ethics:Demographics}. I approached recruitment through purposive sampling methods which moves away from random form of sampling, but rather adopts a process to \textit{"select respondents that are most likely to yield appropriate and useful information}(pg.317)\citep{kelly2010qualitative}. To begin with, I selected presenters, exhibitors and attendees from Dementia Lab conferences (2016-2019) - this is an international conference featuring design and HCI work with people with dementia \citep{brankaert_dementia_2019}. Once participants from Dementia Lab expressed interested, I employed snowball sampling, which asks current participants to recommend potential participants of interest who have similar experiences to design, HCI and dementia \citep{noy_sampling_2008}. In the demographic table, participants were asked to self identify their career stages as: early - junior researcher/lecturer, mid - senior researcher/lecturer and senior - professor.

\subsection{Ethics}
\label{Ethics:Ethics}
Newcastle University granted ethical approval for this study. Each participant was emailed an overview of what would be expected from the interview and the study, and provided with consent form and information sheets. Due to the sensitivity of the topics discussed in the interview, all participants have been anonymised for privacy purposes.

\subsection{Data collection}
\label{Ethics:dataCollection}
Mindful that the interviews would be touching on sensitive topics, I adopted the reflexive position of 'connected knowing', which involves empathy, and perspective-taking to understand the other's perspective that further recognises disagreement or disparity \citep{belenky_womens_1986}. With this in mind, while I conducted the majority of the interviews, specific interviews where the participant had a prior relationship with other authors of the study led the interview to provide a more comfortable space for sharing personal stories on dementia. For all interviews, I developed a semi-structured interview schedule (see appendix \ref{app:EthicInterview}), which consisted of open-ended questions and prompts on: 1) experience in dementia research, 2) power relationships, 3) experiences with institutional ethics processes, 4) HCI ethics, 5) building relationships with people with dementia, 6) dissemination of knowledge, 7) exit strategies, and 8) how we define impact. Interviews lasted from 45 minutes to 70 minutes. Interviews were carried out in person where possible, but were otherwise carried out over video calls. All the interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed in full.

\subsection{Data and analysis}
\label{Ethics:Analysis}
Data collection consisted of 1100 minutes (average 50 minutes per interview) stretching across 22 interviews. With the large dataset, Dr. Kellie Morrissey and Dr. Sarah Foley supported initial coding by coding half of the data to compare to my coding of the 22 interviews to avoid bias \citep{berends_using_2005}. Throughout the project, I led weekly meetings with the authors to reflect on what I saw in the data, agree on codes, subcategories and the building of themes. My analytical approach followed \cite{braun_using_2006,braun_one_2020} Thematic Analysis (TA). This process followed a seven step process. First, I prepared the transcripts. Second, myself and the other two coders familiarised ourselves with the data and referring to the research questions. Third, I began to generate labels to identify relevant data - for example, \textit{explaining the use of data'}
, \textit{'learning by observing'}, and \textit{'novelty not always necessary'}. For consistency and avoid bias, I then compared my coding with the other two authors to ensure sufficient concordance. In the fourth and fifth steps, I invited authors to take part in a Skype call to organise codes into potential themes to gain multiple perspectives and have opportunities to address disagreements and reflect on the themes that had been generated throughout the analysis. In the sixth step, I began to frame the themes around the research question and defined and named the themes. Finally, the seventh step is the developing and writing of the analysis that is presenting in the following section below.
