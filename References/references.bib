In each case we discuss the nature of intergenerational play, the methodological issues, and explore opportunities for technological innovation through the 'Collage'. We argue that existing knowledge concerning the nature of support for the young-or-older users engaged in instrumental activities are inadequate when we wish to build understanding of and design for young-and-older users, engaged in collective playfulness.

While previous research has provided a foundational understanding of the social affordances surrounding people's interactions with music, there is a need to update this understanding in light of recent key developments in our digital technological landscape.

It extends previous research by revealing the impact key technologies have on how, where, when, and with who people's interactions surrounding music occur. It also reveals people's creative attempts to design their musical experiences with others through reconfiguring and connecting to various digital technologies and digital platforms in order to pursue more opportunities for communicating, sharing, bonding, and celebrating lives with others.},

	abstract = {Changing patterns of domestic life mean that it is increasingly common for people to work away from home for extended periods. Communications technologies are arguably positioned to help repair ensuing emotional disconnects. We are exploring the use of technology to support re-engagement in the quotidian rituals of family life to foster emotional connectedness whilst away from home. Adopting a design research approach, we develop five sensibilities for productively critiquing and developing design proposals for such domestic technologies. These sensibilities, Temporality, Expression, Connectivity, Reciprocality and Perceivable Volume, are derived from a critical analysis of 68 extant designs, which we illustrate with six exemplars supporting differing levels of ritualistic behaviour. To demonstrate the critical utility of these sensibilities for design processes, we interrogate two early design sketches. We contribute further critical reflections on design research methods and the role of ‘design critique' in technology development.},

Through the reflections of our participants, and our design response to these, we have used the design of digital jewellery as a window on the family as an emotional entity. In doing so we escape conventional assumptions as to how technology might support family life, and instead propose alternative forms of technology that serve as acceptable sites for highly personalised and personally significant emotional statements. Two designs are presented, Traces and Blossom, which are both responses to the lives and personal accounts of our participants, and a challenge to the conventions of interaction design. By reflecting on our designs we identify and unpick assumptions as to the nature of the digital technology with a view to opening up a design space that places an emphasis on both the individual and the authentic character of our emotional lives. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Embodiment reflects both a physical presence in the world and a social embedding in a web of practices and purposes. After a review of the role that embodiment has played in philosophies of presence and action through the twentieth century, the outline of a new foundation for the design and analysis of interactive systems is presented.},

We present findings from literature together with our own observations to determine if there are distinguishing characteristics for Deaf children that may influence design sessions with them. We found that Deaf children generally have reduced literacy and slower academic progress, reduced social and emotional development, reduced empathy and a level of nervousness in novel situations, delayed language development, and limited or delayed spoken language. We also found that Deaf children are active and innovative in approaching communication, have sensitive visual attention in their peripheral vision, enhanced attention to small visual changes, and a capacity for visual learning. Finally, cultural issues within the Deaf community mean that Deaf children should be free to interact on their own terms in a design situation. We suggest that these differences merit the development of a design approach specific to the needs of Deaf children. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

	isbn = {0-203-99461-2},
	abstract = {First published in 1945, Maurice Merleau-Ponty's monumental Phénoménologie de la perception signalled the arrival of a major new philosophical and intellectual voice in post-war Europe. Breaking with the prevailing picture of existentialism and phenomenology at the time, it has become one of the landmark works of twentieth-century thought. This new translation, the first for over fifty years, makes this classic work of philosophy available to a new generation of readers. Phenomenology of Perception stands in the great phenomenological tradition of Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre. Yet Merleau-Ponty's contribution is decisive, as he brings this tradition and other philosophical predecessors, particularly Descartes and Kant, to confront a neglected dimension of our experience: the lived body and the phenomenal world. Charting a bold course between the reductionism of science on the one hand and "intellectualism" on the other, Merleau-Ponty argues that we should regard the body not as a mere biological or physical unit, but as the body which structures one's situation and experience within the world. Merleau-Ponty enriches his classic work with engaging studies of famous cases in the history of psychology and neurology as well as phenomena that continue to draw our attention, such as phantom limb syndrome, synaesthesia, and hallucination.},

Is the autistic child actually “mindblind” as proposed by Baron-Cohen? I argue that J. has a difficulty in situating himself in the bodily expressive world of children and adults. Mainly three areas are discussed in the article: 1) J.'s relationship to other children, especially his way of playing. 2) J.'s communicative relationship to others. 3) J.'s fragmentary experience of time. Focus is on Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological theory of the relation between body and world. In a concluding chapter I finally suggest that an educational practise has to be bodily expressive (playful and humorous) if you want to get into contact with the autistic child.},

	abstract = {The quality of a virtual environment, as characterized by factors such as presence and fidelity, is of interest to developers and users of simulators for many reasons, not least because both factors have been linked to improved outcomes in training as well as a reduced incidence of simulator sickness. Until recently, most approaches to measuring these factors have been based on subjective, postexposure questioning. This approach has, however, been criticized because of the shortcomings of self-report and the need to delay feedback or interrupt activity. To combat these problems, recent papers on the topic have proposed the use of behavioral measures to assess simulators and predict training outcomes. Following their lead, this paper makes use of a simple perceptual task in which users are asked to estimate their simulated speed within the environment. A longitudinal study of training outcomes using two of the simulators revealed systematic differences in task performance that matched differences measured using the perceptual task in a separate group of control subjects. A separate analysis of two standard presence questionnaires revealed that they were able to predict learning outcomes on a per individual basis, but that they were insensitive to the differences between the two simulators. The paper concludes by explaining how behavioral measures of the type proposed here can complement questionnaire-based studies, helping to motivate design aspects of new simulators, prompting changes to existing systems, and constraining training scenarios to maximize their efficacy.},

The objective of this study was to examine the relationships between burnout, depression, and quality of life in home caregivers of patients with dementia. The participants were 84 home caregivers (39 male; 45 female), and they were asked to complete three questionnaires: the Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II), the WHO Quality of Life 26 (WHO-QOL26), and the Pines Burnout Measure (BM). Results from a bivariate correlation showed that BM scores significantly correlated with the scores on BDI-II and WHO-QOL26. Results from ANOVA comparing the level of burnout with the scores on BDI-II and WHO-QOL26 revealed that there were differences between the burnout groups and the scores on BDI-II and WHO-QOL26. The higher levels of burnout were found to correspond to higher levels of depressive symptoms and lower QOL. These findings suggest that caregiver intervention to reduce burnout might benefit from strategies to reduce depression and increase QOL. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Recent work in cultural theory claims that this “in-between” region, or “third space,” is a fertile environment in which participants can combine diverse knowledges into new insights and plans for action. This can include articulating, clarifying, and informing the needs of themselves as individuals, and of the people they are connected to or responsible for – e.g., depending on who the user is, their organizations, institutions, products, and services, or their classmates, playmates, families, and schools, or other people with similar situations, circumstances, challenges, or who face similar kinds of social stigma. Important attributes of third space experiences include challenging assumptions, learning reciprocally, and creating new ideas, which emerge through negotiation and co-creation of identities, working languages, understandings, and relationships, and polyvocal (many-voiced) discussions across and through differences. The chapter focuses on participatory practices that share these attributes, including: site-selection of PD work; workshops; story-collecting and storytelling through text, photography, and drama; games for analysis and design; and the co-creation of descriptive and functional prototypes.},

We don't just use technology, they point out; we live with it. They offer a new approach to understanding human-computer interaction through examining the felt experience of technology. Drawing on the pragmatism of such philosophers as John Dewey and Mikhail Bakhtin, they provide a framework for a clearer analysis of technology as experience. Just as Dewey, in Art as Experience, argued that art is part of everyday lived experience and not isolated in a museum, McCarthy and Wright show how technology is deeply embedded in everyday life. The "zestful integration" or transcendent nature of the aesthetic experience, they say, is a model of what human experience with technology might become. McCarthy and Wright illustrate their theoretical framework with real-world examples that range from online shopping to ambulance dispatch. Their approach to understanding human-computer interactionseeing it as creative, open, and relational, part of felt experienceis a measure of the fullness of technologys potential to be more than merely functional.},

It describes how feminist contributions to debates in the philosophy of science have helped clarify relationships among objectivity, values, data collection and interpretation, and social consequences. Feminists have proposed and implemented strategies to pursue scientific and moral agendas together and with equal rigor. In this paper, we assess the epistemologies, methodologies, and methods of feminist social science relative to prior and ongoing research efforts in HCI. We conclude by proposing an outline of a feminist HCI methodology.},

However, to turn this potential into concrete design applications, a qualitative understanding of how people engage with sound is needed. This paper presents the outcomes of three workshops, exploring the personal experiences evoked by soundscapes of people in early to mid-stages of dementia. Using the dementia soundboard, we provide key insights into how sounds from everyday life triggered personal associations, memories of the past, emotional responses, and the sharing of experiences. Furthermore, we identified several design considerations and practical insights for sound-based technologies in the context of dementia care. This paper sets out a path for further design-research explorations and development of concrete sound-based interventions, for enriching the everyday lives of people with dementia.},

	abstract = {Probes have been adopted with great enthusiasm in both Design and HCI. The heterogeneity with which they have been used in practice reflects how the method has proved elusive for many. Originators and commentators of probes have discussed misinterpretations of the method, highlighting the lack of accounts that describe in detail the design of probes and their use with participants. This paper discusses our particular use of Design Probes as directed craft objects that are both tools for design and tools for exploration across a number of projects, spanning a decade, centered on self-identity and personal significance. In offering an example of what a framework for probe design and use might look like, we attempt to address the identified lacuna, providing a synthetic account of probe design and use over an extended period and conceptualizing the relationship between the properties of probes and their use in design projects.},

	title = {The {Definition} of {Morality}},
	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/morality-definition/},
	abstract = {The topic of this entry is not—at least directly—moraltheory; rather, it is the definition of morality. Moraltheories are large and complex things; definitions are not. Thequestion of the definition of morality is the question of identifyingthe target of moral theorizing. Identifying this targetenables us to see different moral theories as attempting to capturethe very same thing. In this way, the distinction between a definitionof morality and a moral theory parallels the distinction John Rawls(1971: 9) drew between the general concept of justice andvarious detailed conceptions of it. Rawls’ terminology,however, suggests a psychological distinction, and also suggests thatmany people have conceptions of justice. But the definition/theorydistinction is not psychological, and only moral theorists typicallyhave moral theories., There does not seem to be much reason to think that a singledefinition of morality will be applicable to all moral discussions.One reason for this is that “morality” seems to be used intwo distinct broad senses: a descriptive sense and a normative sense.More particularly, the term “morality” can be usedeither, Which of these two senses of “morality” a theorist isusing plays a crucial, although sometimes unacknowledged, role in thedevelopment of an ethical theory. If one uses “morality”in its descriptive sense, and therefore uses it to refer to codes ofconduct actually put forward by distinct groups or societies, one willalmost certainly deny that there is a universal morality that appliesto all human beings. The descriptive use of “morality” isthe one used by anthropologists when they report on the morality ofthe societies that they study. Recently, some comparative andevolutionary psychologists (Haidt 2006; Hauser 2006; De Waal 1996)have taken morality, or a close anticipation of it, to be presentamong groups of non-human animals: primarily, but not exclusively,other primates., Any definition of “morality” in the descriptive sense willneed to specify which of the codes put forward by a societyor group count as moral. Even in small homogeneous societies that haveno written language, distinctions are sometimes made between morality,etiquette, law, and religion. And in larger and more complex societiesthese distinctions are often sharply marked. So “morality”cannot be taken to refer to every code of conduct put forward by asociety., In the normative sense, “morality” refers to a code ofconduct that would be accepted by anyone who meets certainintellectual and volitional conditions, almost always including thecondition of being rational. That a person meets these conditions istypically expressed by saying that the person counts as a moralagent. However, merely showing that a certain code would beaccepted by any moral agent is not enough to show that the code is themoral code. It might well be that all moral agents would also accept acode of prudence or rationality, but this would not by itself showthat prudence was part of morality., As we’ve just seen, not all codes that are put forward bysocieties or groups are moral codes in the descriptive sense ofmorality, and not all codes that would be accepted by all moralagents are moral codes in the normative sense of morality. So anydefinition of morality—in either sense—will requirefurther criteria. Still, each of these two very brief descriptions ofcodes might be regarded as offering some features of morality thatwould be included in any adequate definition. In that way they mightbe taken to be offering some definitional features ofmorality, in each of its two senses. When one has specified enoughdefinitional features to allow one to classify all the relevant moraltheories as theories of a common subject, one might then be taken tohave given a definition of morality. This is the sense of“definition” at work in this entry., Explicit attempts to define morality are hard to find, at least sincethe beginning of the 20th century. One possible explanationfor this is the combined effect of early positivistic worries aboutthe metaphysical status of normative properties, followed (oraugmented) by Wittgensteinian worries about definitions of anysignificant terms whatsoever. Whatever the explanation, whendefinitions have been offered, they have tended to be directed at thenotion of moral judgment (Hare 1952, 1981) rather than at moralityitself. To the degree that these definitions are adequate, they might,without much effort, be converted into definitions of morality in thedescriptive sense. For example, a particular person’s moralitymight be regarded as the content of the basic moral judgments thatperson is prepared to accept. However, as G. Wallace and A.D.M. Walker(1970) note, virtually all “definitions” of moraljudgments are only the specification of one definitional feature oranother., What counts as definitional of morality, in either sense of“morality”, is controversial. Moreover, the line betweenwhat is part of a definition, in the sense at issue, and what is partof a moral theory, is not entirely sharp. For example, some mightregard it as definitional of morality, in the normative sense, that itgoverns only interpersonal interactions. Others, however, might takethis to be a substantive theoretical claim. Some might take it asdefinitional of “morality” in its descriptive sense thatit be a code of conduct that a person or group takes to be mostimportant. But others might say that attention to religion casts doubton this idea., “Morality”, when used in a descriptive sense, has animportant feature that “morality” in the normative sensedoes not have: a feature that stems from its relational nature. Thisfeature is the following: that if one is not a member of the relevantsociety or group, or is not the relevant individual, then accepting acertain account of the content of morality, in the descriptive sense,has no implications for how one should behave. On the other hand, ifone accepts a moral theory’s account of moral agents, and thespecifications of the conditions under which all moral agents wouldendorse a code of conduct as a moral code, then one accepts that moraltheory’s normative definition of “morality”.Accepting an account of “morality” in the normative sensecommits one to regarding some behavior as immoral, perhaps evenbehavior that one is tempted to perform. Because accepting an accountof “morality” in the normative sense involves thiscommitment, it is not surprising that philosophers seriously disagreeabout which account to accept.},

However, theories of experience-centered design do little to account for emotion work undertaken by design researchers when doing this. As a consequence, how a design researcher's emotions are experienced, navigated and used as part of an ECD process are rarely published. So, while emotion is clearly a tool that we use, we don't share with one another how, why and when it gets used. This has a limiting effect on how we understand design processes, and opportunities for training. Here, we share some of our experiences of working with ECD. We analyse these using Hochschild's framework of emotion work to show how and where this work occurs. We use our analysis to question current ECD practices and provoke debate.},

The design followed a two-year ethnography, from which the need for highlighting participation and supporting agency for residents within the care home became clear. The residents use of Printer Pals mediated participation in a number of different ways, such as engaging with the technology itself, offering shared experiences and participating in co-constructive and meaningful ways, each of which is discussed.

Phronesis describes wisdom and judgment garnered from practical experience of specific situations in context. Applied phronesis contributes everyday wisdom to challenging issues for vulnerable target users. Drawing on research into mHealth technologies for psychological wellbeing, we explore how phronesis can inform ethical design. Using a case study on an app for self-reporting symptoms of depression during pregnancy, we present a framework for incorporating a phronetic approach into design, involving: (a) a wide feedback net to capture phronetic input early in design; (b) observing the order of feedback, which directly affects value priorities in design; (c) ethical pluralism recognising different coexisting value systems; (d) acknowledging subjectivity in the disclosure and recognition of individual researcher and participant values. We offer insights into how a phronetic approach can contribute everyday wisdom to designing mHealth technologies to help designers foster the values that promote human flourishing.},

Following an approach grounded in Responsible Research Innovation, we present the findings from a workshop in which artists, curators, commissioners, and researchers explored ethical challenges revealed by four case studies. We identify six ethical challenges for HCI's engagement with cultural applications: transgression, boundaries, consent, withdrawal, data, and integrity. We discuss two broader implications of these: managing tensions between multiple overlapping ethical frames; and the importance of managing ethical challenges during and after an experience as well as beforehand. Finally, we discuss how our findings extend previous discussions of Value Sensitive Design in HCI.},

	abstract = {Consent theoretically threads through the whole qualitative research method, so getting this right can set the tone for person-centred relationships between researcher and participants. However, most attention has been given in the UK to cognitively biased informed consent and to consent taking place at the beginning of projects; and in North America to assent or the lack of objection. The method in this article is based on the premise that for persons with a dementia, informed consent becomes increasingly redundant and consequently exclusionary to them as persons. This article sets out and describes a method for consent that focuses on persons with dementia, traditionally excluded from consent and thus from research, and also refocuses on consent as a process that runs through the whole of a research project. It also suggests that use of this model can strengthen the assent process. Examples from two contrasting doctoral studies will be offered to illustrate the method in action. The first study investigates wandering in older persons with dementia living in a nursing home. The second study is a randomized control trial investigating an intervention for heel sores in older persons with dementia as patients on orthopaedic wards in a general hospital.},

In relation to dementia care, first, Deceptive practices in managing a family member with Alzheimer's disease. Symbolic Interaction, 17(1), 21-36) distinguished between four kinds of lies used by staff: 'going along with a misperception', 'with-holding the truth', 'little white lies' and 'use of tricks'. This article examined the issue of deception, developing a questionnaire to investigate attitudes towards lying to people with dementia. Secondly, information on the use of lies was presented within a workshop to determine whether it would lead to attitude change.
METHOD: This study used a two-phased design. The first phase involved developing a 16-item questionnaire. The second phase validated the use of the questionnaire through a workshop; therapists' responses to a teaching programme were assessed.
RESULTS: The psychometric properties of the questionnaire are reported. Following the workshop, participants were found to have a more positive attitude towards the use of lies. The reasons underpinning changes in attitude are discussed.
CONCLUSION: This study contributes to a more informed understanding regarding both the definition and use of lies. On the whole, participants developed a less generic perspective about lying, becoming more supportive of lies when used in specific situations in the best interests of the recipients.},

Though meaningful social interaction is integral to quality of life in dementia, initiating conversation with a person with dementia can be challenging, especially for younger people who may lack knowledge of someone's life history. This can be further compounded without a nuanced understanding of the nature of dementia, along with an unfamiliarity in leading and maintaining conversation. We designed a mobile application - Ticket to Talk - to support intergenerational interactions by encouraging young people to collect media relevant to individuals with dementia to use in conversations with people with dementia. We evaluated Ticket to Talk through trials with two families, a care home, and groups of older people. We highlight difficulties in using technologies such as this as a conversational tool, the value of digital media in supporting intergenerational interactions, and the potential to positively shape people with dementia's agency in social settings.},

This study contributes an extended understanding of the quality of experience and the means of making sense in dementia, as well as unpicking the potential of ECD to support enriched experience and contextual meaning-making for people with dementia. Finally, we delineate what it is about Experience-Centred Design that differentiates the approach from other often-used approaches in designing in dementia contexts: 1) explorative thinking, 2) working within 'cuttings-out of time and space', 3) careful yet expressive methodology and documentation, and 4) working together to imagine futures.

Some inconsistencies are bad because they are due to irrationality, or carelessness, or the operation of conflicting interests, an so should be reduced or removed. Other inconsistencies, we argue, are not bad and should be left or even encouraged. In this paper we examine three arguments to reject the view that we should strive for complete consistency between committees. The first argument is that differences in judgement are not necessarily incompatible with ideas of justice for patients who are potential participants of research reviewed by different committees. We call this 'the justice argument.' The second argument is that such committees do not have access to a single moral truth, to which their judgement is supposed to correspond. We call this the 'moral pluralism argument.' The third argument is that the process of ethics committee review is also morally relevant and not solely the outcome. We call this the 'due process argument.' While we fall short of establishing exactly how much variation and on what substantive issues would ethical permissible, we show that it is largely inevitable and that a certain amount of variation could be seen as a desirable part of the institution of medical research.},

New technologies are now being designed and evaluated in settings that involve vulnerable or marginalized participants and that can be emotionally challenging for researchers. Research in these settings can produce complex ethical dilemmas that are often emergent, diverse, and highly contextualized. In addition, there may be discrepancies between the realities of HCI fieldwork and the formal and often rigid processes of obtaining ethics approval in research institutions. Given these issues, it is important for researchers to communally reflect on ethical encounters in HCI research. This workshop will provide a forum for researchers to share experiences about ethical challenges they have faced.

We elaborate this account through a framework for aesthetic experience built around three themes: (1) a holistic approach wherein the person with feelings, emotions, and thoughts is the focus of design; (2) a constructivist stance in which self is seen as continuously engaged and constituted in making sense of experience; and (3) a dialogical ontology in which self, others, and technology are constructed as multiple centers of value. We use this framework to critically reflect on research into the aesthetics of interaction and to suggest sensibilities for designing aesthetic interaction. Finally, a digital jewelery case study is described to demonstrate a design approach that is open to the perspectives presented in the framework and to consider how the framework and sensibilities are reflected in engagement with participants and approach to design.},

First, the ethics of qualitative research design pose distinctive demands on principles of informed consent, conﬁdentiality and privacy, social justice, and practitioner research. I focus on consent – for its topicality, not because it is more important or difﬁcult – and social justice. Second, ﬁeldwork ethics raise special considerations regarding power, reciprocity and contextual relevance. Third, ethical issues raised by the analysis and uses of qualitative inquiry evoke illustrative questions regarding the ethics of narrative research and the utilization of research.},

Despite some evidence of interest and popularity of these services, little is known about how posthumous messages may impact the people who receive them. We present a qualitative study that explores the type of experiences potentially triggered upon receiving such messages. Our findings firstly suggest that posthumous messaging services have the potential to alter the relationship between the bereaved and the deceased, and secondly provide insight into how users make sense of this altered relationship. Through the inference of a set of design considerations for posthumous communication services, we reveal a number of conflicts that are not easily solvable through technological means alone, and which may serve as starting points for further research.

A multi-disciplinary coding team was formed, with individuals from research, clinical and service use backgrounds. Challenges in the team approach included the different skill levels brought to the task, resource needs across multiple coders, and time demands on team members. Benefits rested in the inclusion of multiple perspectives in researcher backgrounds and in the opportunities to discuss coding disagreements and refine the coding system. Having two primary coders reduced flexibility in the iterative process of coding analysis, particularly interpretive and pattern coding. The codebook was useful for coding and writing findings.

We then examine how the two institutions primarily devoted to human development—the family and the schools—both promote and hinder women's development.  Most of what we say is based on extensive interviews with ordinary women living ordinary lives. Our informants were rural and urban American women of different ages, class and ethnic backgrounds, and educational histories. At the time of the interview, many of the women were in the midst of dramatic personal and intellectual changes, and they told us about recent, as well as distant, transitions in the way they perceived themselves and the world around them.

Convenience Sampling and Purposive Sampling are Nonprobability Sampling Techniques that a researcher uses to choose a sample of subjects/units from a population. Although, Nonprobability sampling has a lot of limitations due to the subjective nature in choosing the sample and thus it is not good representative of the population, but it is useful especially when randomization is impossible like when the population is very large. It can be useful when the researcher has limited resources, time and workforce. It can also be used when the research does not aim to generate results that will be used to create generalizations pertaining to the entire population. Therefore, there is a need to use nonprobability sampling techniques. The aim of this study is to compare among the two nonrandom sampling techniques in order to know whether one technique is better or useful than the other. Different articles were reviewed to compare between Convenience Sampling and Purposive Sampling and it is concluded that the choice of the techniques (Convenience Sampling and Purposive Sampling) depends on the nature and type of the research.},

	abstract = {Reflexivity is commonly used in qualitative research and has been posited and accepted as a method qualitative researchers can and should use to legitimize, validate, and question research practices and representations. This paper closely examines the role of reflexivity as a methodological tool as it intersects with debates and questions surrounding representation and legitimization in qualitative research, within modernist and postmodernist ideologies, and pays close attention to how reflexivity is being defined and used in present-day research. Specifically, the author identifies and discusses the problematics of four common trends in present-day uses of reflexivity: reflexivity as recognition of self, reflexivity as recognition of other, reflexivity as truth, and reflexivity as transcendence. The author argues for a move away from comfortable uses of reflexivity to what she terms uncomfortable reflexive practices and provides an overview of the work of three authors who practice reflexivities of discomfort. Practicing uncomfortable reflexivity interrupts uses of reflexivity as a methodological tool to get better data while forefronting the complexities of doing engaged qualitative research.},

	abstract = {This article elaborates the social ontology and methodology of carnal sociology as a distinctive mode of social inquiry eschewing the spectatorial posture to grasp action-in-themaking, in the wake of debates triggered by my apprenticeship-based study of boxing as a plebeian bodily craft. First I critique the notions of (dualist) agent, (externalist) structure, and (mentalist) knowledge prevalent in the contemporary social sciences and sketch an alternative conception of the social animal, not just as wielder of symbols, but as sensate, suffering, skilled, sedimented, and situated creature of flesh and blood. I spotlight the primacy of embodied practical knowledge arising out of and continuously enmeshed in webs of action and consider what modes of inquiry are suited to deploying and mining this incarnate conception of the agent. I argue that enactive ethnography, the brand of immersive fieldwork based on “performing the phenomenon,” is a fruitful path toward capturing the cognitive, conative, and cathectic schemata (habitus) that generate the practices and underlie the cosmos under investigation. But it takes social spunk and persistence to reap the rewards of “observant participation” and achieve social competency (as distinct from empirical saturation). In closing, I return to Bourdieu’s dialogue with Pascal to consider the special difficulty and urgency of capturing the “spirit of acuteness” that animates such competency but vanishes from normal sociological accounts.},

Further, discrepancies may arise between the structured processes of formal ethics approval in universities and other organisations and the realities of HCI fieldwork 'in the wild'. This workshop builds on our CHI 2015 workshop, providing an opportunity for HCI researchers and others to communally reflect on ethical encounters in HCI research. We particularly focus on situational ethics, researcher wellbeing, maintaining boundaries around the research, issues of consent and participation, and ethical issues arising from the disruption that new technologies cause.

Although this process varies by country, the underlying principles are universal. While this process is often a formality, for field research or lab-based studies with vulnerable users, formal ethics requirements can be challenging to navigate -- a common occurrence in the social sciences; yet, in many cases, foreign to HCI researchers. Nevertheless, with the increase in new areas of research such as mobile technologies for marginalized populations or assistive technologies, this is a current reality. In this paper we present our experiences and challenges in conducting several studies that evaluate interactive systems in difficult settings, from the perspective of the ethics process. Based on these, we draft recommendations for mitigating the effect of such challenges to the ethical conduct of research. We then issue a call for interaction researchers, together with policy makers, to refine existing ethics guidelines and protocols in order to more accurately capture the particularities of such field-based evaluations, qualitative studies, challenging lab-based evaluations, and ethnographic observations.},

Although there are numerous examples of how to conduct qualitative research, few sophisticated tools are available to researchers for conducting a rigorous and relevant thematic analysis. The purpose of this article is to guide researchers using thematic analysis as a research method. We offer personal insights and practical examples, while exploring issues of rigor and trustworthiness. The process of conducting a thematic analysis is illustrated through the presentation of an auditable decision trail, guiding interpreting and representing textual data. We detail our step-by-step approach to exploring the effectiveness of strategic clinical networks in Alberta, Canada, in our mixed methods case study.

	abstract = {The effects of dementia derive from a great deal more than the documented neuropathological changes in the brain of the person thus diagnosed and can be exacerbated or ameliorated to some degree by the way the person is positioned by others in the everyday social world. By analysing the nature of their social interactions with others we can readily come to appreciate that the ways in which the person with dementia is treated by others can have a profoundly positive or profoundly negative effect on (1) the subjective experience of the person with dementia; (2) the degree to which the person can display remaining intact cognitive abilities; (3) the ability of the person to meet the demands of everyday life; and (4) the quality of the person's social life and the meaning found in each day.Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu in Zulu conveys the idea that, ‘a person is a person through others’. When we begin to think about the practical meaning of this Zulu idea as it applies to people with dementia, we are confronted with what might appear to be a disjunction in the way in which persons and their attributes are viewed socially and the way in which a person's attributes are understood in terms of biomedical approaches to disease. Likewise, we are also sensitized more deeply regarding the nature of the social interactions that occur between a person with dementia and healthcare professionals. In the biological model, the tendency is to attempt to understand the nature of a disease and its signs and symptoms by viewing the diagnosed person in isolation. Social interactions are limited to those with the examining clinicians. The effects of the disease are solely understood in terms of the physical and mental changes that have occurred in the person as a result of, in the case of dementia, neuropathology. Thus, by comparing the ways in which the person comported themselves in previous years to their present comportment, we note losses. Such losses are attributed to the neuropathology of the disease and these, taken together with the person's subjective complaints, are referred to as the signs and symptoms of the illness. Our biomedical conceptualization is further informed by the person's performance on neuropsychological tests and how that performance compares to that of age-matched, otherwise healthy, people. The ways in which family informants report the person's actions and discourse as being less coherent or efficient than previously are interpreted as being ‘effects’ caused by the illness alone. Thus, relatively little weight is given to the possibility that there might be psychosocial influences that also affect the person's actions. However, the medical literature has not always been antithetical to a broader approach.It was Lipowski who noted that a disease is not to be understood as being separate from the afflicted person and that a person encompasses not only a biological organism but also the world of …feeling and symbolic activities in thought and language. Furthermore, he is a member of a social group with which he interacts. A concept of disease is incomplete unless it takes cognizance of these facts. How a person experiences the pathological process, what it means to him, and how this meaning influences his behaviour and interaction with others are all integral components of disease as viewed as a total human response. (Lipowski 1969, p. 1198)Taking this line of thinking further, Lipowski states rather pointedly, The response of the family caregiver and other meaningful people to the patient's illness or disability, to his communications of distress, and to his inability to perform the usual social roles may spell the difference between optimal recovery or psychological invalidism. (Lipowski 1969, p. 1200)Exactly what sorts of responses to the person with the diagnosis have the potential to promote recovery or ‘psychological invalidism’? Before attempting to answer this question, it is important to recognize that in almost all types of dementia complete or near complete recovery is not currently possible. Still, even if we put aside the possibility of full recovery, optimal functioning, if attainable and sustainable for even a short time, could have profoundly positive effects not only on the person with dementia but also on their family and carers. That is to say, if it were possible to provide some interventions that might facilitate the ability of the person with dementia to communicate as effectively as possible, to interact with others as coherently as possible, and to sustain their sense of self-worth in the face of the effects of brain injury, it would be tremendously advantageous psychologically as well as financially to all concerned.One purpose of the present chapter is to explore possible psychosocial interventions aimed at avoiding psychological invalidism. First, however, it is important to explore some subtle ways in which attitudes and actions of those deemed healthy may have untoward effects on the person with dementia.},

They examine different ways of understanding contributions to knowledge through research but more especially exploring ideas about contributions to changing praxis. Changing praxis necessarily involves changing not only each participant as an individual actor, but changing patterns of activity. In most praxis‐related research, this is pursued by involving a widening range of participants in a setting. This poses the further problem that the ripple effects of the project are not entirely under the researcher’s control. Thus, as the title suggests, praxis‐related research serves two masters. Very often, R \& D projects aim to make contributions to social science. Generally they also aim to make contributions to the world of human affairs. Different criteria are appropriate for judging each.},

This paper provides an early stage reflection of the design, development and delivery of a bespoke entrepreneurship module, designed to empower students and provide them with skills to build successful startup businesses. This course was designed specifically for Computer Science and Mathematics students, within a cohort-learning environment. Students were guided through the principles of the Ostervalder Business Model Canvas, allocated into groups and asked to devise a business idea, iterating this throughout an eight week period. Students were provided with support from teaching staff alongside weekly coaching from successful entrepreneurs and flipped classroom tuition. The teaching methods employed in the Professional Skills course are not traditionally used in Computer Science education and students reported a number of challenges in completing the module. These included team dynamics, time and investment required and the requirement for engagement with stakeholders. All of these issues highlight the unique nature and practical application of the course material, presenting the opportunity for reflection of the success and impact of the module. In addition, the tutors of the course reflect on their experience of delivering the course for the first time, and their response to student feedback.

	doi = {10.1007/s10551-017-3522-6},
	abstract = {This article explores the integration of the seemingly disparate notions of care ethics and design thinking. The business community has adapted “design thinking” from engineering and architecture to facilitate innovation and problem solving through participatory processes. “Care ethics” is a relational approach to morality characterized by a concern for context, empathy, and action. Although design thinking is receiving significant attention and application in business practices, care ethics has only achieved limited traction among business ethicists in academia. “Caring design” is offered as a mutually beneficial integration of the two ideas. Care ethics and design thinking have much in common. For example, the relational and responsive dimension of design thinking is analogous in some important ways, namely empathy and inquiry, to the relational and responsive approach of care ethics. The shared themes in care ethics and design thinking make the integration of the two plausible and reciprocal advantages make the combination compelling. Explicit ethical language can shape design thinking as more than a tool of productivity while the participatory processes of design thinking can aid in expanding the circle of care ethics as a social and political ethic. Furthermore, caring design may provide a palatable path for greater acceptance of care ethics among business professionals. An overview of design thinking and care ethics is offered prior to exploring how the synergies are mutually beneficial. The article concludes with a focus on how to educate the next generation of business students for caring design.},

Policy ambitions to put people at the center of their own care are being developed internationally. These may be seen as part of the evolution of person-centered care which has its origins in critical perspectives on practice and social responses to people with dementia. In England, one further development of person-centered care has been personalization – a government policy to extend individuals’ choice and control over their social care and, latterly, ways to meet their health care needs. This paper charts the evolution of the concept of person-centered care to the policy of personalization (which has international comparators) and summarizes emerging and conflicting evidence about the implications of personal budgets in England on older people with mental health problems such as dementia and their families. It focuses on the evidence base of personalization and on emerging lessons for practice, drawing from the implementation of personalization and the adoption of personal budgets by this group. While personalization may be one policy initiative, the values and practices of person-centered dementia care remain fundamental to practice and are inspiring new ideas related to rights and justice for people with dementia.},

Today, following a war-laden twentieth century and the failure of militarism and “get tough” approaches to solve domestic and global problems, Addams’s social theorizing, which emphasizes cosmopolitan experiences and sympathetic connections, provides a provocative alternative to Western notions of individualism, transactional relations, and spectator epistemology. Feminist Interpretations of Jane Addams brings together many of the leading Addams scholars in North America to consider Addams’s ongoing relevance to feminist thought.},

Our research covers a full design process including a qualitative-empirical pre-study, the prototyping process and the investigation of long-term appropriation processes of the stable prototypes in three different practice environments. Specifically, we deal with the problem of 'wandering' by persons suffering from late-phase dementia. Although GPS tracking is not a novel technological objective, the usage of those systems in dementia care remains very low. The paper therefore takes a socio-technical stance on development and appropriation of GPS technology in dementia care and assesses the practical and ideological issues surrounding care to understand why. We additionally provide design research in two different settings, familial and institutional care, and report on the design of a GPS-based tracking system reflecting these considerations. What comes to the fore is the need for ICT to reflect complex organizational, ideological and practical issues that form part of a moral universe where sensitivity is crucial.},

Computer applications that are created for the workplace need to be designed with full participation from the users—both from a democratic point of view and to insure that competencies central to the design are represented in the design group. Full participation requires training and active cooperation, not just token representation in meetings or on committees. The term cooperative design is used to designate such cooperation between users and designers. However, to users, designing a new computer application is a secondary activity whereas for designers it is their primary work. This means that the designers should know how to set up the process and need to make sure that everyone gets something out of the interaction. The cooperative design approach begins by creating an environment in which users and designers can actively consider the future use situation. It is a process where users and designers do not have to wait until the final act to know if the application will fit the practice of the users.},

Not only are broad vistas of inquiry opened for study, but the very foundations of psychological knowledge itself are thrown into critical relief. When the implications are fully explored, it becomes apparent that this form of social inquiry could become foundational for understanding the nature of human knowledge. Both the philosophy and the science of human knowledge might give way to social analysis. Of course, these are bold conjectures, and as we shall see, to make good on them one may have to relinquish much that is sacred.

Methodological discussions have commonly addressed a variety of methods for collecting and analyzing empirical material, yet the critical grounds upon which these were reformulated have rarely been extended to embrace sampling concepts and procedures. The latter have been overlooked, qualifying only as a ‘technical’ research stage. This article attends to snowball sampling via constructivist and feminist hermeneutics, suggesting that when viewed critically, this popular sampling method can generate a unique type of social knowledge—knowledge which is emergent, political and interactional. The article reflects upon researches about backpacker tourists and marginalized men, where snowball sampling was successfully employed in investigating these groups' organic social networks and social dynamics. In both studies, interesting interrelations were found between sampling and interviewing facets, leading to a reconceptualization of the method of snowball sampling in terms of power relations, social networks and social capital.},

We briefly outline two distinct studies: (1) a design study that examines mobile interactions of backpackers, and (2) an urban sociology study to better understand social networks of apartment residents. The first study follows a participatory design approach. The second study is guided by action research principles. We reflect on the research practice of these two studies in order to discuss the key methodological features of each. We would like to invite the larger participatory design community to continue the comparison and exploration we have begun here. By outlining the tools and techniques, and the application thereof we hope to promote the usefulness of action research for participatory design projects and vice versa.

	abstract = {National and international codes of research conduct have been established in most industrialized nations to ensure greater adherence to ethical research practices. Despite these safeguards, however, traditional research approaches often continue to stigmatize marginalized and vulnerable communities. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) has evolved as an effective new research paradigm that attempts to make research a more inclusive and democratic process by fostering the development of partnerships between communities and academics to address community-relevant research priorities. As such, it attempts to redress ethical concerns that have emerged out of more traditional paradigms. Nevertheless, new and emerging ethical dilemmas are commonly associated with CBPR and are rarely addressed in traditional ethical reviews. We conducted a content analysis of forms and guidelines commonly used by institutional review boards (IRBs) in the USA and research ethics boards (REBs) in Canada. Our intent was to see if the forms used by boards reflected common CBPR experience. We drew our sample from affiliated members of the US-based Association of Schools of Public Health and from Canadian universities that offered graduate public health training. This convenience sample (n = 30) was garnered from programs where application forms were available online for download between July and August, 2004. Results show that ethical review forms and guidelines overwhelmingly operate within a biomedical framework that rarely takes into account common CBPR experience. They are primarily focused on the principle of assessing risk to individuals and not to communities and continue to perpetuate the notion that the domain of “knowledge production” is the sole right of academic researchers. Consequently, IRBs and REBs may be unintentionally placing communities at risk by continuing to use procedures inappropriate or unsuitable for CBPR. IRB/REB procedures require a new framework more suitable for CBPR, and we propose alternative questions and procedures that may be utilized when assessing the ethical appropriateness of CBPR.},

	abstract = {Dance, as aesthetic self-expression, is a unique arts-based program that combines the physical benefits of exercise with psychosocial therapeutic benefits. While dance has also been shown to support empowerment, meaningful self-expression, and pleasurable experience, it is rarely adopted to support these aspects of engagement in the context of dementia care. The instrumental reduction of dance to its application as a therapeutic tool can be traced to the contemporary movement towards cognitive science with an emphasis on embodied cognition. This has effectively elided a consideration of how the body itself, separate and apart from cognition, could be a source of intelligibility, inventiveness, and creativity. We argue for the need to broaden the therapeutic model of dance to more fully support embodied and creative self-expression by persons living with dementia. To achieve this, we explore how a relational model of citizenship that recognizes corporeality and relationality as fundamental to human existence brings a new and critical dimension to understanding the importance of dance in the context of dementia. Drawing on this model, we articulate a new kind of ethic characterized by a pre-reflective intercorporeal sensibility that requires the mobilization of public structures and practices to cultivate a relational environment for individuals living with dementia that supports human flourishing.},

Initial applications of VR in other aspects of medicine and psychology have yielded encouraging results, but continued research and understanding of this evolving technology will be crucial for its effective integration into rehabilitation. This article provides a brief introduction to VR technology, examines the specific benefits VR offers consumers and providers of rehabilitation services and discusses potential areas of application and important considerations in applying this technology.

Through VR devices deployed by news organisations such as the New York Times, and multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, users will be so powerfully immersed in, for example, a street demonstration, or a refugee camp, that the empathy they feel may constitute a new strengthening of the fourth estate’s civic role in informing and enlightening the public, to the extent that it can go beyond subjective empathy to develop a shared basis for political participation in civil society. The essay considers these claims from the overarching context of what is called digitality. It argues that human agents are analogue agents from an analogue world. Digitality, by contrast, is an essentially alienating sphere wherein digital media cannot replicate analogue communication processes without generating gaps, voids, and ‘missing information’. It further argues, extending insights from Guy Debord, that what VR does produce is a powerful ‘integrated spectacle’ that is a pale substitute for the form of interactive experience needed for the generation of empathy. Taken together, the essay concludes that empathy, a contestable term in its common understanding to begin with, cannot be generated from a digital source. Moreover, should VR become the next dominant post-mobile technological wave as the tech giants predict, then people, users and consumers of VR products in the fourth estate news context, will be further distanced from the analogue reality of the actual world.},

By bringing together diverse scenarios from workshop participants, and bespoke design fictions created specifically to explore the ethics of VR, we will facilitate a rich discussion that will inform the development of three high-fidelity design fictions that will be used to explore the ethics of VR in future workshops, including one in Bristol, UK in November 2019, part of the Virtual Realities Immersive Documentary Encounters project.},

	abstract = {Explicit in the current construction of Alzheimer’s disease is the assumption that memory impairment caused by cognitive deﬁciencies leads to a steady loss of selfhood. The insistence that selfhood is the exclusive privilege of the sphere of cognition has its origins in the modern western philosophical tradition that separates mind from body, and positions the former as superior to the latter. This dichotomy suggests a fundamental passivity of the body, since it is primarily cognition that is held to be essential to selfhood. In contrast to the assumed erasure of selfhood in Alzheimer’s disease, and challenging the philosophical underpinnings of this assumption, this paper presents the ﬁndings of an ethnographic study of selfhood in Alzheimer’s disease in a Canadian long-term care facility. It argues and demonstrates that selfhood persists even with severe dementia, because it is an embodied dimension of human existence. Using a framework of embodiment that integrates the perspectives of Merleau-Ponty and Bourdieu, it is argued that selfhood is characterised by an observable coherence and capacity for improvisation, and sustained at a pre-reﬂective level by the primordial and socio-cultural signiﬁcance of the body. The participants in this study interacted meaningfully with the world through their embodied way of ‘being-in-the-world ’.},

Following a discussion of contrasting approaches to these power relations, I present a reflexive examination of a research project on sexual identities. My reflections highlight some of the key ethical questions that face researchers conducting fieldwork, especially with regard to the relationship between the researcher and those being researched. My discussion of these dilemmas reflect the situated and partial nature of our understanding of “others.” I argue that the researcher's positionality and biography directly affect fieldwork and that fieldwork is a dialogical process which is structured by the researcher and the participants.},

As a consequence, despite advances in person-centred care, the body, which is a substantive means by which persons with advancing dementia engage with the world, is treated as passive rather than active and intentional. My central argument is that dementia care practices must embrace the idea that the body is a fundamental source of selfhood that does not derive its agency from a cognitive form of knowledge. With an interest in bringing the body into a theoretical re-visioning of selfhood in Alzheimer's disease, I advance this idea with the notion of embodied selfhood. I suggest ways that the notion of embodied selfhood could enhance person-centred dementia care; however, further research is required in order to fully conceptualize this notion in the context of dementia care.},

She argues that, in truth, vulnerability is strength and when we shut ourselves off from vulnerability - from revealing our true selves - we distance ourselves from the experiences that bring purpose and meaning to our lives.Daring Greatly is the culmination of 12 years of groundbreaking social research, across every area of our lives including home, relationships, work, and parenting.

It is challenging for researchers and developers in this field to actively involve people with dementia in development. This review updates and builds on existing knowledge by including a contemporary and relevant perspective. This perspective was gained by including search words and search databases from the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and Design, as these fields were expected to supply novel insights in the complex task of actively involving people with dementia in developing supportive technologies. A total of 49 out of 3456 studies were included which describe the development of a great variety of technologies. Often people with dementia were involved in the generative or evaluative phase of the development. Interviews and observations were most commonly used methods. In seven articles the people with dementia were co-designers. This literature review reflects that people with dementia can influence the development of technology in regards to content, design, and even the initial idea, although the impact on how they experience their own involvement remains largely unknown. There is a lack of specific knowledge on appropriate methods and materials for active involvement of people with dementia in supportive technology development, even when including articles from the field of HCI and Design. Future research is needed to further appreciate and improve the desired role of people with dementia in meaningful technology development.},

These traditions opened the door for contemporary field workers to unapologetically forge close relationships to setting members. Several ethical evaluations have emerged from this intimate literature warning researchers of the harm that can come when we “go to far” in the quest for intimate familiarity. In this paper, I reflect on some of the debates regarding intimacy and exploitation by examining my experiences of dating, marrying, and eventually divorcing my key informant. I trace the way that, despite my attempts to follow the existing ethical guides, I reinforced several larger inequalities in my intimate stance. Using my failure to avoid or mitigate harm, I argue that our discussions of intimate methods and immersion in the field have failed to accurately note how we reinforce or resist structure in our research endeavors. Viewing ourselves as “doing structure” in the field would lead us to stop debating whether intimacy is better than objectivity, celibacy is better than sex, disclosure is better than silence, or conventional behavior is better than deviance in the field. Instead, we should locate how our behaviors, research roles, or discursive choices enact structures and the effect this enactment has on the people who we research.},

	abstract = {There are currently more than 33,000 people known to have dementia in Ireland. Due to 
its complex and multi-faceted nature, the impact of dementia on all those affected is 
extensive. Existing theories of stigma posit that possessing a disability such as dementia 
can result in a perception of difference between the person and others in the community, 
and potentially predispose the person with dementia to stigmatisation and discrimination. 
By association carers/family members of the person with dementia may also be subject to 
the effects of stigma or its components. It has been suggested that dementia related 
stigma is a concern in terms of the provision of dementia care and that it poses an 
obstacle to the well-being and quality of life of persons with dementia and their carers. 
To date this subject has not been explored in-depth from an Irish perspective. 
Consequently, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland commissioned this exploratory research, 
to better understand this issue and gain insight into how to respond to dementia related 
stigma in an Irish context},

It argues that, if the aim of feminist and other critical geographies is to acknowledge their partiality, then the particular form of reflexivity advocated needs careful consideration. Feminist geographers most often recommend a kind of reflexivity that aims, even if only ideally, at a full understanding of the researcher, the researched and the research context. The article begins with the author's failure at that kind of reflexivity, and that particular reflexivity is then discussed and described as ?transparent? in its ambitious claims to comprehensive knowledge. The article then goes on to explore critiques of transparent reflexivity, many of which have been made by feminist geographers themselves. The article concludes by suggesting that some recent discussions of the uncertainties of research practice offer another model of feminist reflexivity that may succeed more effectively in questioning the researcher's practice of knowledge production.},

In response to this issue we have created App Movement, a platform that enables the promotion, collaborative design, and deployment of community-commissioned mobile applications. The platform facilitates collaborative customization of a common app template, for which the development and deployment of the app is fully automated. We describe the motivation, design and implementation of App Movement, and report the findings from an 8 month deployment wherein 27 campaigns were created, 11 of which have been successful, and over 1,600 users pledged their support using the platform. We present three case studies to demonstrate its use and adoption in successful and unsuccessful campaigns. We discuss the implications of these studies, including questions of governance (ownership of content, liability of user generated content and moderation), sustainability and the potential to extend App Movement beyond location-based review apps.},

We translated urban design proposals developed by residents and the local authority to enable children to contribute ideas to the project. Our process comprised three stages: situated explorations and evidence gathering through digitally supported neighbourhood walks; issue mapping and peer-to-peer discussions using an online engagement platform; and face-to-face dialogue between children, residents, and the local authority through a 'Town Hall' event. We report insights gained through our engagement and show how our activities facilitated issue advocacy and the development of children's capacities, but also surfaced tensions around the agency of children in political processes. We reflect on the challenges of working in this space, and discuss wider implications for technology design and ethical questions that 'scaling up' such work might pose.},

Care and Connect saw significant support in its early stages on the online platform, yet failed to engage participants in its design phase and deployment. To unpick this, we contribute an account of its initial use in the community, and then describe findings from research engagements with carers and people with dementia. These workshops used Care and Connect to structure discussions of participants' own experiences of dementia-friendliness, and uncovered themes of 1) trust, 2) exclusion versus inclusion, 3) duration and quality of time, and 4) empathy becoming action. Using this evidence, we advance an account of online community commissioning as a process which needs to understand not only the general issues ongoing in communities facing significant life challenges, but also the particularity of community members' experiences.},

We explore the methodological issue of positionality and discuss the ways in which gatekeepers drew on different axes of the researcher's identities – religion, ethnicity, gender and age – in ambiguous and contradictory ways. In analysing this relationship, we locate the discussion within its historical context, as we contend that contextuality influenced the way gatekeepers positioned the researcher. This paper draws on the field experiences of the first author in four inner-city neighbourhoods in Bradford, West Yorkshire, a northern city with a well-established Pakistani Muslim community that has become synonymous with the Rushdie affair and the 1995 and 2001 urban disturbances.},

Accountable is a web-based tool that visualises and relates open financial data provided by local government and non-profit organisations (NPOs) in the UK. A qualitative study was conducted where Accountable was treated as a technology probe, and used by representatives of NPOs and members of the public who invest their time or effort voluntarily into such organisations. The study highlighted how: current open data sets provided by public bodies are inadequate in their representation of funding structures; the focus on finance and fiscal expenditure in such data makes invisible the in-kind effort of volunteers and the wider beneficiaries of an organisation's work; and problems arising from the interoperability of open data technologies. The paper concludes with implications for the design of future systems, considering the domains of transparency and accountability in relation to the findings.},

Addressing stigma around mental health was seen as a greater priority for many, as was addressing the inadequate mental health information and support available to LGBTIQ+ young people through schools and mainstream health services. Participants noted that a mental health app must not only be useful, reliable and accessible but also actively sought, which was sometimes unlikely. This article questions a contemporary public health agenda for developing digital solutions to complex social problems. Furthermore, it asks whether health inequities and social stigma can be addressed by apps that typically prioritise the practice of individualised self-care.},

In the work presented in this paper, discussions with carers, as well as a more formal user-survey, provided a good understanding of the issues that are faced by this group, and useful indications of potential design solutions. This preliminary survey work led to a design approach that used carer emulation, familiarity of appearance, incorporation of verbal prompts and reminders, and careful user-monitoring, to achieve effective devices. This design approach is illustrated through several examples of specific designs. Evaluations of stand-alone systems were carried out prior to smart home installation, and illustrated the complex interface that exists between assistive technology and people with dementia.},

In this paper we ask whether these values can hold up in practice, particularly as participation takes on new meanings and incorporates new perspectives. We argue that much HCI research leans towards configuring participation. In exploring this claim we explore three questions that we consider important for understanding how HCI configures participation; Who initiates, directs and benefits from user participation in design? In what forms does user participation occur? How is control shared with users in design? In answering these questions we consider the conceptual, ethical and pragmatic problems this raises for current participatory HCI research. Finally, we offer directions for future work explicitly dealing with the configuration of participation.},

However, concerns are expressed that the use of fake bus stops could cause more harm than good for PwD, due to their deceptive nature and the potential stigmatisation of individuals seated at a fake bus stop. This article discusses the ethical aspects of using fake bus stops and outlines considerations prior to setting up fake bus stops in nursing homes in keeping with good clinical practice in dementia care.

Professional caregivers to these individuals may better understand them and their suffering (and thus provide more compassionate care), if they look at the illness in the context of the individual's life. Although their personhood has been threatened by dementia, appreciating the gestalt, or integrity of their lives may help preserve it. The clinical focus, which currently looks only at problems, should also assess the individual's remaining strengths, positive functions and characteristics. A case scenario helps to illustrate these suggestions. Some recommendations to researchers, clinicians and bioethicists for further study in this area are included., Les maladies mentales, comme la maladie d'Alzheimer, causent des changements substantiels chez les personnes qui en sont atteintes, ce qui nous porte parfois à dire qu'elles sont devenues des « personnes différentes ». Les professionnels qui prodiguent des soins à ces personnes peuvent mieux les comprendre, de même que leur souffrance (et ainsi faire preuve de plus de compassion à leur endroit) lorsqu'ils envisagent la maladie dans le contexte de la vie quotidienne. Bien que l'identité de ces personnes soit menacée par la maladie, l'étude de la gestalt, ou l'intégrité de leur vie, peut les aider à préserver leur santé mentale. L'intervention clinique, qui à l'heure actuelle traite uniquement les problèmes, devrait également évaluer les forces, les fonctions et les caractéristiques positives des personnes atteintes. Une étude de cas vient illustrer ces suggestions.

	abstract = {Objective
Late diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) may be due to diagnostic uncertainties. We aimed to determine the sequence and timing of the appearance of established early signs and symptoms in people who are subsequently diagnosed with AD.

Methods
We used systematic review methodology to investigate the existing literature. Articles were reviewed in May 2016, using the following databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, British Nursing Index, PubMed central and the Cochrane library, with no language restriction. Data from the included articles were extracted independently by two authors and quality assessment was undertaken with the quality assessment and diagnostic accuracy tool-2 (QUADAS tool-2 quality assessment tool).

Results
We found that depression and cognitive impairment were the first symptoms to appear in 98.5\% and 99.1\% of individuals in a study with late-onset AD (LOAD) and 9\% and 80\%, respectively, in early-onset AD (EOAD). Memory loss presented early and was experienced 12 years before the clinically defined AD dementia in the LOAD. However, the rapidly progressive late-onset AD presented predominantly with 35 non-established focal symptoms and signs including myoclonus (75\%), disturbed gait (66\%) and rigidity. These were misdiagnosed as symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) in all the cases. The participant with the lowest mini-mental state examination score of 25 remained stable for 2 years, which is consistent with the score of the healthy family members.

Conclusions
The findings of this review suggest that neurological and depressive behaviours are an early occurrence in EOAD with depressive and cognitive symptoms in the measure of semantic memory and conceptual formation in LOAD. Misdiagnosis of rapidly progressive AD as CJD and the familial memory score can be confounding factors while establishing a diagnosis. However, the study was limited by the fact that each one of the findings was based on a single study.},

	abstract = {According to recent surveys, dementia worry (DW) is a widespread phenomenon in mid-life and old age, at least in Western populations. DW has been shown to be only loosely related to sociodemographic factors. Unfortunately, the concept of DW has found only very little conceptual and empirical attention in previous research. In this conceptual review, we take (mostly) a psychological approach to DW. First, we define DW as an emotional response to the perceived threat of developing dementia. We then conceptualise DW as a hybrid, combining elements of ageing anxiety and health anxiety. On the population level, we argue that the high prevalence of DW may be reflective of the increasing awareness of dementia in times of increasing ‘‘dementia encounters’, widespread misperceptions of risks and consequences of dementia and a perceived lack of coping resources. Finally, we propose that DW may affect a range of important behaviours, such as how people interpret evidence of their own or others’ age-related cognitive changes, how they interact with people with dementia, how they anticipate and plan for their future, how they engage in screening and prevention behaviours and how they exploit healthcare resources. We conclude with suggestions for future research, including a further in-depth investigation of psychological and micro-/macrosocial factors associated with DW.},

	abstract = {The use of HIV serostatus information has played a pivotal role in partner selection norms. A phenomenon known as serosorting is the practice of selecting a partner based on a perception that they are of the same HIV status in order to avoid transmission from one partner to the other. An understudied aspect of serosorting is that it has a divisive effect—one accepts or rejects a potential partner based on a singular characteristic, the partner's HIV status, and thus excludes all others. This division has been formally referred to as the HIV serodivide. In this study, we explored partner selection strategies among a group of HIV-negative, young men who have sex with men (n = 29) enrolled in a PrEP demonstration project in Northern California. We found that trends in serosorting were in fact shifting, and that a new and opposite phenomenon was emerging, something we labeled “seromixing” and that PrEP use played a part in why norms were changing. We present three orientations in this regard: (1) maintaining the phobia: in which men justified the continued vigilance and exclusion of people living with HIV as viable sex or romantic partners, (2) loosening/relaxation of phobia: among men who were reflecting on their stance on serosorting and its implications for future sexual and/or romantic partnerships, and (3) losing the phobia: among men letting go of serosorting practices and reducing sentiments of HIV-related stigma. The majority of participants spoke of changing or changed attitudes about intentionally accepting rather than rejecting a person living with HIV as a sex partner. For those who maintained strict serosorting practices, their understandings of HIV risk were not erased as a result of PrEP use. These overarching themes help explain how PrEP use is contributing to a closing of the HIV serodivide.},

The basis of the argument put forward in this article is that narrative and narrativity are centrally constitutive of the personhood and the Self.

Relatively recently there has been a move toward developing a citizenship model of dementia as a framework within which people with dementia can be empowered. This development is, however, currently under-theorised. The argument presented here is that in order to develop that model we need to find ways of integrating narrative and citizenship, thus linking the personal and the political.},

Such practices have been advanced as socially inclusive activities that help to affirm personhood and redress the biomedical focus on loss and deficit. However, in emphasizing more traditional forms of creativity associated with the arts, more mundane forms of creativity that emerge in everyday life have been overlooked, specifically with regard to how such creativity is used by people living with dementia and by their carers and family members as a way of negotiating changes in their everyday lives. In this paper, we propose a critical approach to understanding such forms of creativity in this context, comprised of six dimensions: everyday creativity; power relations; ways to operationalise creativity; sensory and affective experience; difference; and reciprocity. We point towards the potential of these dimensions to contribute to a reframing of debates around creativity and dementia.},

Because narratives are situationally produced and interpreted, they have no necessary political or epistemological valence but depend on the particular context and organization of their production for their political effect. The analysis specifies the variable conditions that produce hegemonic tales-stories that reproduce existing relations of power and inequity-and subversive stories-narratives that challenge the taken-for-granted hegemony by making visible and explicit the connections between particular lives and social organization.},

Drawing on the concept of narrative citizenship, we describe a community-based, critical arts-based project where persons with dementia, family members, visual and performance artists, and researchers came together to interrogate the tragedy discourse and construct an alternative narrative of dementia using the arts. Our research demonstrates the power of the arts to create transformative spaces in which to challenge dominant assumptions, foster critical reflection, and envision new possibilities for mutual support, caring, and relating.

	abstract = {Abstract This paper explores the varied meanings and lived experiences of older people with dementia, in relation to everyday technologies in public spaces outside the home, through re-analysis of qualitative data generated from research that focused on the use of technology in supporting people with dementia to carry on with their everyday outside activities. The data have been re-analysed to critically examine how people with memory loss manage being outside in both familiar and unfamiliar public environments. In doing so the authors explore how technologies mediate between the physical and social environment in which people with dementia live. This paper highlights the importance of a neglected space within dementia research, namely the outside public environment. Although the outside environment and activities that take place in that space, for some, are curtailed, for others the physical and social security of familiar environments enables them to carry on with everyday activities in this public realm. Outside space can be both therapeutic and frightening and this paper demonstrates that people with dementia can sometimes feel out of place in public space. It however also shows the variety of ways people with dementia use everyday technologies to manage 'feeling out of place'.},

	abstract = {This essay examines the relevance of socio-material space to the social model. The social model has been criticised as being disembodied. While there is some basis for this critique, the social model, in fact, has 'bodies in space' as a central concern. A distinction is made between disability as a sociocultural and biomedical category, and as a state of 'not being able to'. The latter usage is not just relevant to people with disabilities. In order to illustrate the strength of the social model, disabling social organisations of space-time practises are examined with a special emphasis on transport-public space. It is concluded that the social model offers insights into relationships between bodies, embodied agency and the social organisation of space-time.},

To accomplish this, design in digital civics emphasizes the importance of relationships based on dialogue, empowerment, and participation; all of which are contingent upon the existence of trust. Currently, however, these relationships are most often characterized by entrenched distrust which problematizes opportunities for dialogue and participation. In this paper, we explore how design might support trust in the relational aims of digital civics. To do so, we led 13 public officials in a large US city through a design-based inquiry centered around the role of trust in their various efforts to engage communities. In our findings, we discuss four strategies for supporting trust in digital civics.},

This paper reports on four phases of a design and research project, from sensitising user-engagement and user-centred design, to the development and in-the-wild deployment of a mobile phone application called FeedFinder. FeedFinder has been developed with breastfeeding women to support them in finding, reviewing and sharing public breastfeeding places with other breastfeeding women. We discuss how mobile technologies can be designed to support public health endeavours, and suggest that public health technologies are better aimed at communities and societies rather than individual.},

Numerous CSCW-related disciplines examine marginalized people's use of social technology and its relationship to wellbeing.

We aim to bring together health, design, communication, HCI, STS, and a spectrum of diversity science researchers to discuss what digital wellbeing looks like for marginalized populations, share the state of knowledge in respective fields, and identify opportunities for leveraging social technologies for wellbeing across these communities. We will engage in exercises intended to foster mutual understanding, identify commonalities between areas of inquiry, and bridge gaps between research areas.

Their standpoint depends on previous experiences and their sense of identity, as well as on their social position relative to research participants and their communities.

However, the way identities affect Participatory Design with children has so far been neglected in research, even though previous works focus on children's and researchers' roles in the design process or encourages auto-ethnography. In this paper, we build on case studies of how identities as they relate to gender and disability shape relationships between researchers and marginalised children through Participatory Design. We show how these identities are continuously negotiated throughout the design process, and how they shape outcomes. We close by proposing an approach to systematic reflexivity on identity in participatory design.},

Recent scholarship in HCI and design has analyzed the ways collaborative design engagements, such as PD situated in the design workshop can amplify voices and empower underserved populations. Yet, we argue that PD as instantiated in the design workshop is very much an affluent and privileged activity that often neglects the challenges associated with envisioning equitable design solutions among underserved populations. Based on two series of community-based PD workshops with underserved populations in the U.S., we highlight key areas of tension and considerations for a more equitable PD approach: historical context of the research environment, community access, perceptions of materials and activities, and unintentional harm in collecting full accounts of personal narratives. By reflecting on these tensions as a call-to-action, we hope to deconstruct the privilege of the PD workshop within HCI and re-center the focus of design on individuals who are historically underserved.},

Our investigation also reveals the need to reexamine some of the assumptions made in HCI about the relationship people have with technology.

	abstract = {This paper reports on an investigation of how homeless young people hold themselves in relation to personal digital artifacts. Twelve participants, aged 19-29, took part in semi-structured interviews. Participants answered questions about the acquisition and disposition of personal artifacts, digital and non-digital, including mobile phones, music players, and wallets. The analysis of the interview transcripts reveals that young people often part with their digital artifacts in order to meet immediate needs, including the need to create and reciprocate goodwill. This contingent holding of personal artifacts illuminates both the ordinary and extraordinary circumstances of homelessness. The paper concludes with a discussion of constraints and implications for the design of information systems for improving the welfare of homeless young people.},

Though work to date has largely addressed functional needs, there is a growing recognition of the importance of supporting meaningful activities. However, technology for active, rather than passive, engagement is relatively novel beyond specific applications (e.g., music or reminiscence therapy). To better understand how to support active engagement of people with dementia in activities, we interviewed nineteen practitioners. Our findings reveal differing approaches to making sense of the actions of people with dementia, as well as to engaging them in activities. We discuss the importance of tracing epistemological understandings of dementia to different configurations of technology for people living with dementia and provide a practical guide to support designers to do so. Finally, we discuss considerations for the design of dementia technologies around facilitating self-actualization and managing emotional exposure for care-providers.},

We interviewed 22 HCI researchers with experience working in dementia care contexts. Our qualitative analysis outlines subsequent lessons-learned, such as recognition of the participants, self-care, research impact, and subjectivity in ethical review boards. Furthermore, we found the complexity of navigating both "everyday" and more formal, institutional ethics in dementia research has implications beyond the context of working with people with dementia and outline key considerations for ethical practices in socially orientated HCI research.},

The study was conducted in five localities across the UK. Findings – The study draws attention to the benefits of advocacy as a means of supporting older people with dementia and illuminates internal and external challenges encountered by third sector organisations providing this type of support. Research limitations/implications – The study captures the additional dimension that austerity brings to third sector organisations working in this field and the ways in which financial constraints are shaping the field of dementia advocacy.

In tandem with this distribution of open data is the promotion of civic hackathons, or “app contests” by government. The civic hackathon is designed to offer prize money to developers as a way to spur innovative use of open data, more specifically the creation of commercial software applications that deliver services to citizens. Within this context, we propose that the civic hackathon has the potential to act in multiple ways, possibly as a backdoor to the traditional government procurement process, and as a form of civic engagement. We move beyond much of the hype of civic hackathons, critically framing an approach to understanding civic hackathons through these two lenses. Key questions for future research emphasize the emerging, and important, nature of this research path.},

Software is increasingly seen as a way to promote positive social change: this includes initiatives such as Code for America and events such as hackathons, which strive to build innovative software solutions with a social conscience. From a software engineering perspective, existing software processes do not always match the needs of these social software projects, which are primarily aimed at social change and often involve vulnerable communities. In this paper, we argue for new software processes that combine elements of agile, iterative development with principles drawn from action research and participatory design. The former allow social software projects to be built quickly with limited resources; the latter allow for a proper understanding of the social context and vulnerable user groups. The paper describes Speedplay, a software development management framework integrating these approaches, and illustrates its use in a real social innovation case study.},

Despite originating in technology communities, hackathons have now been widely adopted by a broad range of organisations. This mainstreaming of hackathons means they encompass a very different range of attendees and activities than they once did, to the extent that some events billed as hackathons may involve no coding at all. Given this shift away from production of code, they might instead be seen as an increasingly popular participatory design activity, from which designers and researchers in HCI can learn. Through fieldwork at six hackathons that targeted non-technical communities, we identify the types of activities and contributions that emerge through these events and the barriers and tensions that might exist. In doing so, we contribute a greater understanding of hackathons as a growing phenomenon and as a potential tool for participatory research.},

The first phase of our study was centred upon a hackathon during which teams of designers were asked to conceptualise and prototype digital products or services for those affected by self-harm. We discuss how value-sensitive actions and activities, including engagements with those with lived experiences of self-harm, were used to scaffold the conventional hackathon format in such a challenging context. Our approach was then extended through a series of critical engagements with clinicians and charity workers who provided appraisal of the prototypes and designs. Through analysis of these engagements we expose a number of design challenges for future HCI work that considers self-harm; moreover we offer insight into the role of stakeholder critiques in extending and rethinking hackathons as a design method in sensitive contexts.},

	abstract = {Communities of making have been at the center of attention in popular, business, political, and academic research circles in recent years. In HCI, they seem to carry the promise of new forms of computer use, education, innovation, and even ways of life. In the West in particular, the maker manifestos of these communities have shown strong elements of a neoliberal ethos, one that prizes self-determination, tech-savvy, independence, freedom from government, suspicion of authority, and so forth. Yet such communities, to function as communities, also require values of collaboration, cooperation, interpersonal support-in a word, care. In this ethnographic study, we studied and participated as members of a hackerspace for 19 months, focusing in particular not on their technical achievements, innovations, or for glimmers of a more sustainable future, but rather to make visible and to analyze the community maintenance labor that helps the hackerspace support the practices that its members, society, and HCI research are so interested in. We found that the maker ethic entails a complex negotiation of both a neoliberal libertarian ethos and a care ethos.},

Social media could support them in doing this, but no previous studies have comprehensively analysed their use of Twitter. The aims of this study were to identify how people with dementia use Twitter and examine the illness identities they create and promote online. Tweetcatcher was used to collect 2774 tweets posted over six months by 12 account holders with dementia, across three countries. Tweets were analysed thematically. Six themes were identified through the analysis: nothing about us without us, collective action, experts by experience, living with dementia not suffering from it, community, and stories of dementia. On Twitter, people with dementia are developing a collective illness identity to further a social movement that is focused on improving the lives of people with dementia. They are also communicating their personal identities by documenting their lived experiences. Twitter is being used to convey positive, rather than negative, messages about dementia. The findings of this study also show that thematic analysis can be applied to micro texts that can combine over time to form longer narratives.},

Our 91 survey respondents expressed varying opinions about the need for potential partners to disclose disability status when online dating depending on the nature or perceived severity, with "visible" disabilities carrying a higher expectation of upfront disclosure than "invisible" disabilities. Many disabled respondents also described proactively disclosing as a technique to filter potential connections. Our findings suggest that individuals with disabilities must perform additional labor and navigate complex group norms in pursuit of personal connection. We advocate that the social computing research community consider how these processes are driven by both societal expectation and the constraints of online dating platforms. We then offer design considerations and open questions as a means to extend social computing study at the intersection of online dating and disability studies.},

In this study, we interviewed 12 transgender and non-binary individuals to understand how they find, create, and navigate safe spaces using technology. Managing safety was a universal concern for our transgender participants, and they experienced complex manifestations of harm through technology. We found that harmful experiences for trans users could arise as targeted or incidental affronts, as sourced from outsiders or insiders, and as directed against individuals or entire communities.. Notably, some violations implicated technology design, while others tapped broader social dynamics. Reading our findings through the notions of 'space" and 'place," we unpack challenges and opportunities for building safer futures with transfolk, other vulnerable users, and their allies.},

On the one hand, technologies extend, mediate, and reduce the need for physical spaces for social interaction; on the other hand, there has also been a resurgence in community hubs as existing and new forms of critical resources for diverse individuals and communities. This paper provides a comparative analysis of three creative community hubs in South East Queensland, each representing a case of bottom-up, middle-out, and top-down driven initiatives. By applying the transdisciplinary lens of Urban Informatics, it explores the juxtaposed values of physical space and digital technologies for connectedness within the context of creative communities. It then opens questions about how Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) might add to tactics of connection for meaningful and impactful community engagement.},

In an initial exploration of privacy and safety concerns of participants in online fan communities, we find that they avoid engaging online to preserve their privacy and safety, thus limiting the involvement of already marginalized voices in public discourse. LGBTQIA people in particular practice non-use for fear of being outed in personal spaces if recognized. In response to challenges users face, we recommend that developers consider finer controls over user content in addition to thoughtful practices among researchers and journalists when it comes to sharing "public" data.},

Key challenges were identified, including audience engagement, content persistence and process sustainability. In response, we 1) supported the group's audience engagement using Facebook Live and a phone-in option, and 2) developed a digital production tool. Reporting on the continued use of the tool by the organisation, we discuss how tailored and non-intrusive processes mediated by digital technology can support older adults in delivering richer media experiences whilst serving their civic participatory interests.},

We report findings from four design workshops with 31 pro-choice stakeholders across Ireland in which we positioned an exploratory protosite, HerStoryTold, to engender critical conversations around the use of sensitive abortion narratives as a tool for engagement. Our analysis shows how digital storytelling can help reject false narratives and raise awareness of the realities of abortion laws. It suggests design directions to curate narratives that provoke empathy, foster polyvocality, and ultimately expand the engaged community. Furthermore, this research calls for designers to actively support community mobilization through providing 'stepping stones' to activism.},

For service delivery in domestic violence, many aspire to include feedback from service users on their practice, to drive change in their organisation and performance. Current approaches for capturing and using feedback (i.e. surveys) often fail to record rich, in-depth perspectives that audio-video media affords. In this paper, we present the novel application of a voice-based technology to capture and use feedback to reflect on the delivery of a domestic violence intervention. Across four months, we undertook ethnographic fieldwork through observations of four deployments and four reflective discussions with service-staff in their delivery of a novel domestic violence prevention intervention for violent men. Our findings highlight the tensions with how voice can act as a resource to reflect on and refine existing service practices, and offers insights into how technology can play a more practical role in wider service design.},

In addition to studying how people share information and seek and provide emotional support, a growing area of interest is health activism. In this paper, we analyze how a project centered around sharing "real and raw" experiences with dementia provides a safe platform for people to share their authentic experiences. These accounts counter predominant depictions of dementia and push back on tokenistic involvement of people with this condition. In a study involving observations and interviews with members of this project, we find that people with dementia must negotiate several goals which at times compete with each other: sharing a "real and raw" look at dementia, changing attitudes, showcasing a polished presentation, and inhabiting a safe space. The paper concludes with a discussion of future directions for CSCW on configuring a space for dialogue on sensitive topics, health activism, and sharing online with dementia.},

	abstract = {Improving volunteer performance leads to better caregiving in dementia care settings. However, caregiving knowledge systems have been focused on eliciting and sharing expert, primary caregiver knowledge, rather than volunteer-provided knowledge. Through the use of an experience prototype, we explored the content of volunteer caregiver knowledge and identified ways in which such non-expert knowledge can be useful to dementia care. By using lay language, sharing information specific to the client and collaboratively finding strategies for interaction, volunteers were able to boost the effectiveness of future volunteers. Therapists who reviewed the content affirmed the reliability of volunteer caregiver knowledge and placed value on its recency, variety and its ability to help bridge language and professional barriers. We discuss how future systems designed for eliciting and sharing volunteer caregiver knowledge can be used to promote better dementia care.},

	abstract = {Objectives This Prospero-registered review sought to answer three questions concerning people with dementia involved in speaking out on behalf of themselves and others as dementia advocates. First, what are the views and motivations of the people involved? Second, what impact does this have upon them and others? Third, what are the future policy and research implications?Methods: A systematic search and narrative synthesis of original research was conducted. Searches in Pubmed, Web of Science, PsychINFO and CINAHL followed PRISMA Guidelines. The review focused on people with dementia involved in advocacy. There were no restrictions based on study design or date. Language was limited to English.Results: Seven papers were identified, with predominantly qualitative methodologies. Four overarching themes were identified: threats, fighting back, evolving identities and making a difference. Threats ranged from those arising from dementia as an illness, to exposure to stigma. Fighting back represented advocates’ response to these threats, often described using martial metaphors. Evolving identities captured advocates’ journeys through diagnosis to involvement in advocacy and subsequent impact upon identity. Making a difference represented the impact of dementia advocacy at an individual, community and societal level.Conclusions: This review confirms that the threats associated with dementia extend beyond the symptoms of illness. Dementia advocacy offers potential improvements in well-being for those involved, through the activity itself and via extended social networks. There is little research on broader aspects of advocates’ identity, including ethnicity, gender, and age. There has been little attempt to quantify the impact of dementia advocacy.},

Taken together, these events offer new opportunities and challenges for cooperative work by affording explicit, predictable, time-bounded spaces for interdependent work and access to new audiences of collaborators. This one-day workshop brings together researchers interested in the phenomenon, experienced event organizers, and participants interested in running their own events to consolidate research to-date, share practical experiences, and understand what benefits different event variations may offer, how they may be applied in other contexts, and how insights from studying these events may contribute to CSCW knowledge.},

We explore this question through the ethnographic example of a hackathon, a collaborative software-design competition. We focus specifically on the earliest and, in many ways, most uncertain phase of collaboration, in which commitment and activity simultaneously emerge: team formation. We analyze mercurial allegiances in terms of a technoliberal participation ideology closely associated with the mores of the digital economy, which paradoxically emphasizes intensive project-based collaboration but limited interpersonal responsibility. We examine the verbal and nonverbal resources (such as stance-taking, politeness, reported speech, humor, and gesture) that prospective teammates use to modulate expressions of commitment, and the ways in which they pursue self-interested projects while maintaining social relatedness in order to accomplish joint activity in a context of social volatility.},

Due to the "fun" and informal nature of such events, they make for excellent informal learning platforms that attract a diverse spectrum of students, especially those typically uninterested in traditional classroom settings. In this paper, we investigate the informal learning aspects of Ohio State's annual hackathon events over the past two years, with over 100 student participants in 2013 and over 200 student participants in 2014. Despite the competitive nature of such events, we observed a significant amount of peer-learning -- students teaching each other how to solve specific challenges and learn new skills. The events featured mentors from both the university and industry, who provided round-the-clock hands-on support, troubleshooting and advice. Due to the gamified format of the events, students were heavily motivated to learn new skills due to practical applicability and peer effects, rather than merely academic metrics. Some teams continued their hacks as long-term projects, while others formed new student groups to host lectures and practice building prototypes on a regular basis. Using a combined analysis of post-event surveys, student academic records and source-code commit log data from the event, we share insights, demographics, statistics and anecdotes from hosting these hackathons.},

We analyzed 57 posts from a forum for persons with dementia. Our findings indicate that users engaged with these forums as a means for self-expression, to connect with others, and to identify necessary resources. While seeking these types of information and support, persons with dementia sometimes provide private and vulnerable information as well as direct medical data, often in identifiable ways that would violate HIPPA standards. The tensions between need for support and the information shared presents interesting new challenges and opportunities for CSCW researchers.},

One context in which older adults generate and share content is art therapy for individuals with dementia. Our analysis draws on Altman's notion of privacy and territorial regions to understand what sharing means for this vulnerable population. This theoretical framing reveals the ways in which privacy is cooperatively negotiated, which is in contrast to the individualistic view of existing sharing systems; how older adults derive benefits from sharing depending on interaction with their audience; and how sharing fluctuates between a focus on the process of therapy versus the product depending on privacy needs. Our analysis contributes an understanding of the complex nature of sharing for vulnerable populations and offers design considerations for systems that support this practice.},

This literature review examined the past decade (January 2004 to December 2015) of world-wide research on dementia-related stigma. Using standard systematic review methodology, original research reports were identified and assessed for inclusion based on defined criteria. Initial database searches yielded 516 articles. After removing duplicates and articles that did not fit inclusion criteria (419), 97 articles were reviewed, yielding a final total of 51 publications, mainly originating in the United States and Europe. Studies were assessed for date, geographic region, sample description, methodology, and key findings. Reports were evaluated on 1) how stigmatizing attitudes may present in various subgroups, including in racial or ethnic minorities; 2) stigma assessment tools; and 3) prospective or experimental approaches to assess or manage stigma. Stigma impedes help-seeking and treatment, and occurs broadly and world wide. Stigmatizing attitudes appear worse among those with limited disease knowledge, those with little contact with people with dementia, in men, in younger individuals, and in the context of ethnicity and culture. In some cases, healthcare providers may have stigmatizing attitudes. In research studies, there does not appear to be consensus on how to best evaluate stigma, and there are few evidence-based stigma reduction approaches. Given the projected increase in persons with dementia globally, there is a critical need for research that better identifies and measures stigma and tests new approaches that can reduce stigmatizing attitudes.},

	abstract = {Using existing social media technologies as a resource for design offers significant potential for sustainable and scalable ways of coordinating participation. We look at three exemplar projects in three distinct domains that have successfully coordinated participation through the configuration and augmentation of existing social media technologies: participatory future forecasting, participatory health research, and connectivist learning. In this paper we conceptualise social media technologies as material for design, that is, as the raw material with which coordinated participation is realized. From this we develop a model that proposes four material qualities of social media technologies, morphology, role, representation of activity and permeability, and point to how they can be productively employed in the design of coordination of participation.},

	abstract = {Using personas in requirement analysis and software development is becoming more and more common. The potential and problems with this method of user representation are discussed controversially in HCI research. While personas might help focus on the audience, prioritize, challenge assumptions, and prevent self-referential design, the success of the method depends on how and on what basis the persona descriptions are developed, perceived, and employed. Personas run the risk of reinscribing existing stereotypes and following more of an I-methodological than a user-centered approach. This paper gives an overview of the academic discourse regarding benefits and downfalls of the persona method. A semi-structured interview study researched how usability experts perceive and navigate the controversies of this discourse. The qualitative analysis showed that conflicting paradigms are embedded in the legitimization practices of HCI in the political realities of computer science and corporate settings leading to contradictions and compromises.},

Thus far, research has primarily focused on robotics for the functional and emotional support of older adults. Robotic pets have been developed primarily for the older adult who is perceived as lonely and isolated, and fears have consequently arisen that robots will replace human caregivers and deceive older adults into developing relationships with them. Missing is the perspective of older adults on the ethics of and potential uses for robotic companion pets. In this study, we conducted focus groups with 41 older adults. We discuss concepts raised by focus group participants such as giving into the fiction of the robotic pet, the social role of the robot, and the role of reciprocity in building a relationship with a robotic pet. We present resulting considerations for new directions for robotic pet design for older adults.},

In both experiments, some subjects expected that their work would be evaluated by experts, and others expected no evaluation. Evaluation expectation was crossed, in each experiment, with the presence of others. In the first experiment, the presence of others was operationalized as coaction; half of the subjects worked individually in small groups, and the others worked alone. In the second experiment, the presence of others was operationalized as surveillance; half of the subjects believed they were being watched while working. In both studies, subsequent creativity ratings of subjects’ products were made by expert judges. Effects of evaluation expectation were consistently strong. On a verbal task in Study 1 and an artistic task in Study 2, creativity was lower in the groups expecting evaluation than those not expecting evaluation. Evidence for the social facilitation or social inhibition of creativity was less clear. Coaction had no effect, and surveillance had a weak negative effect. Moreover, there was some evidence that the effect of surveillance was due to experienced evaluation. The results are discussed in terms of motivational and cognitive influences on creativity.},

We describe and discuss the nature of e-mail use in terms of social circles; frequency, type of content and patterns of communication; relationship with other technologies and activities; motivation and interactive experiences. Within this context of everyday use, we uncover and explain the (relative) importance of several interaction barriers, such as cognitive load, difficulties using input devices and perception of visual information. We claim that cognitive difficulties are much more relevant than difficulties in reading from the screen, for instance, so challenging results of current HCI research with older people.

This article examines these claims ethnographically and historically with an eye toward the kinds of social orders such practices produce. This article focuses on a hackathon, one emblematic site of social practice where techniques from information technology (IT) production become ways of remaking culture. Hackathons sometimes produce technologies, and they always, however, produce subjects. This article argues that the hackathon rehearses an entrepreneurial citizenship celebrated in transnational cultures that orient toward Silicon Valley for models of social change. Such optimistic, high-velocity practice aligns, in India, with middle-class politics that favor quick and forceful action with socially similar collaborators over the contestations of mass democracy or the slow construction of coalition across difference.},

	abstract = {After over a decade of scholarly research and well-documented harassment, sexism, and other forms of exclusion and marginalization, digital games culture is currently the object of heightened attention and discourse related to diversity and inclusion. This paper considers the context of this shift with a particular focus on the relationship between gender-focused inclusivity-based action in the form of women-in-games incubators, post-feminist discourse, and the neoliberal context of digital games production. As opposed to rife anti-feminism and similar “backlash” sentiments, articulations of post-feminism within the digital game industry provide insights into the tensions inherent in introducing action for change within a conservative culture of production, particularly for women in the industry. At the same time, the contradictions and tensions of the post-feminist ethos allow for actions that function through this logic while subverting it. Through a brief consideration of three exemplary post-feminist articulations by visible female figures in the North American digital games community, this article explores the challenges and opportunities presented by the gaps and contradictions of post-feminism in games culture and production. It concludes with equal measures of caution and optimism, indicating future directions for study and activism.},

	abstract = {Designing participation over time is a challenge that is regularly discussed in the fields of Participatory Design (PD) and Codesign. This paper describes two living labs-cases concerned with designing IT during long-term engagements with communities. Both labs aim to enable participatory exchanges after the designer leaves and are thus confronted with challenges that transcend the time of the traditional design ‘project’. We addressed these challenges via defining the IT design process as scripting, which is a process that better articulates the participants’ different voices and timelines. In this process three types of scripts are made, supported by the facilitator role: personal scripts as portrayals of individuals’ views on issues in the community and timelines to address these; community scripts aspiring to combine personal scripts into pluralistic views on the community and scripts for action as ways to rehearse how the community might unfold after the designer leaves. Key to this approach is that diverse people’s views and timelines play a role in co-constructing IT platforms that support participation in the community over time. By creating IT tools that are enabled by and support scripting, designing for participation over time becomes a pluralistic endeavour.},

	abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 outbreak has affected the lives of millions of people by causing a dramatic impact on many health care systems and the global economy. This devastating pandemic has brought together communities across the globe to work on this issue in an unprecedented manner.
Objective: This case study describes the steps and methods employed in the conduction of a remote online health hackathon centered on challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. It aims to deliver a clear implementation road map for other organizations to follow.
Methods: This 4-day hackathon was conducted in April 2020, based on six COVID-19–related challenges defined by frontline clinicians and researchers from various disciplines. An online survey was structured to assess: (1) individual experience satisfaction, (2) level of interprofessional skills exchange, (3) maturity of the projects realized, and (4) overall quality of the event. At the end of the event, participants were invited to take part in an online survey with 17 (+5 optional) items, including multiple-choice and open-ended questions that assessed their experience regarding the remote nature of the event and their individual project, interprofessional skills exchange, and their confidence in working on a digital health project before and after the hackathon. Mentors, who guided the participants through the event, also provided feedback to the organizers through an online survey.
Results: A total of 48 participants and 52 mentors based in 8 different countries participated and developed 14 projects. A total of 75 mentorship video sessions were held. Participants reported increased confidence in starting a digital health venture or a research project after successfully participating in the hackathon, and stated that they were likely to continue working on their projects. Of the participants who provided feedback, 60\% (n=18) would not have started their project without this particular hackathon and indicated that the hackathon encouraged and enabled them to progress faster, for example, by building interdisciplinary teams, gaining new insights and feedback provided by their mentors, and creating a functional prototype.
Conclusions: This study provides insights into how online hackathons can contribute to solving the challenges and effects of a pandemic in several regions of the world. The online format fosters team diversity, increases cross-regional collaboration, and can be executed much faster and at lower costs compared to in-person events. Results on preparation, organization, and evaluation of this online hackathon are useful for other institutions and initiatives that are willing to introduce similar event formats in the fight against COVID-19.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exercising choice and control over decisions is central to quality of life. The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (England and Wales) provides a legal framework to safeguard the rights of people with dementia to make their own decisions for as long as possible. The impact of this on long-term planning has been investigated; everyday decision-making in people's own homes remains unexplored.
METHODS: Using a phenomenological approach, we interviewed 12 dyads (one person with dementia + one carer) four times over one year to ascertain experience of decision-making, how decisions were negotiated, and how dynamics changed. Qualitative interviews were conducted in people's own homes, and thematic analysis was applied to transcripts.
RESULTS: Respecting autonomy, decision-specificity and best interests underlay most everyday decisions in this sample. Over time, dyads transitioned from supported decision-making, where person with dementia and carer made decisions together, to substituted decision-making, where carers took over much decision-making. Points along this continuum represented carers' active involvement in retaining their relative's engagement through providing cues, reducing options, using retrospective information, and using the best interests principle. Long-term spouse carers seemed most equipped to make substitute decisions for their spouses; adult children and friend carers struggled with this.
CONCLUSIONS: Carers may gradually take on decision-making for people with dementia. This can bring with it added stresses, such as determining their relative's decision-making capacity and weighing up what is in their best interests. Practitioners and support services should provide timely advice to carers and people with dementia around everyday decision-making, and be mindful how abilities may change.},

The majority of care for chronically ill people is realized by non-professionals, the relatives, who are often overlooked. Many of these informal caregivers are also elderly and face multiple, seriously demanding challenges in the context of informal care 24/7. In order to support this increasing user group, their cooperative work and coordination adequately, it is essential to gain a better understanding of their care practices and needs. This paper is based on ethnography in ten households in Germany. It combines data from the analysis of participant observations over eight months, interviews and cultural probes. Besides detailed descriptions of two cases, the central features of informal care experience and implications for design are discussed: the self-concept of the caregivers as being care experts, the need for social support, timing issues and coordination with other actors in this field.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: For people living with dementia, the capacity to make important decisions about themselves diminishes as their condition advances. As a result, important decisions (affecting lifestyle, medical treatment and end of life) become the responsibility of someone else, as the surrogate decision-maker. This study investigated how surrogate decision-makers make important decisions on behalf of a person living with dementia.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 34 family members who had formally or informally taken on the role of surrogate decision-maker. Thematic analysis of interviews was undertaken, which involved identifying, analysing and reporting themes arising from the data.
RESULTS: Analysis revealed three main themes associated with the process of surrogate decision-making in dementia: knowing the person's wishes; consulting with others and striking a balance. Most participants reported that there was not an advance care plan in place for the person living with dementia. Even when the prior wishes of the person with dementia were known, the process of decision-making was often fraught with complexity.
DISCUSSION: Surrogate decision-making on behalf of a person living with dementia is often a difficult process. Advance care planning can play an important role in supporting this process. Healthcare professionals can recognise the challenges that surrogate decision-makers face and support them through advance care planning in a way that suits their needs and circumstances.},

We highlight the importance of narrative care, which involves interventions that focus on the person and their unique life narrative. In narrative care, people with dementia are treated not as impaired patients defined by the disease, but as human beings. In doing so, people with dementia can have their own voices back, which is silenced and discredited so many times.},

Besides the renown example of self-driving cars and their potential harmfulness, more mundane software such as social networks can introduce bias, break privacy preferences, lead to digital addiction, etc. Additionally, the software engineering (SE) process itself is highly affected by ethical issues, such as diversity and business ethics. This paper introduces ethics-aware SE, a version of SE in which the ethical values of the stakeholders (including developers and users) are captured, analyzed, and reflected in software specifications and in the SE processes. We propose an analytical framework that assists stakeholders in analyzing ethical issues in terms of subject (software artifact or SE process), relevant value (diversity, privacy, autonomy, ...), and threatened object (user, developer, ...). We also define a roadmap that illustrates the necessary steps for the SE research and practice community in order to fully realize ethics-aware SE.},

Therefore, in order to support the understanding of ethical processes within research across disciplines, this series of practical resources enables group discussion from a range of different angles. The resources are free and open and we hope that different teams will find them useful as they are, but also that some teams will add content to extend the resources in this shared platform. The diversity of research contexts within our global research community will require nuanced content in some resources and we hope that this will become a space to create and share these.
    We suggest beginning by using resources that relate to broader ethical concerns (Values, Team Member Roles and Moral Qualities) then moving to activities that involve support and participants (Critical Friends, Consent and Warp and Weft) and to use the Provocations resource cards both as an activity in its own right and also as a facilitator throughout the other activities to help move the discussion along and bring some practical context to the other resource topics.},

We highlight how ageing is typically defined through an emphasis on the economic and societal impact of health and care needs of older people, concerns around socialisation as people age, and declines in abilities and associated reductions in performance when using technology. We draw from research within the fields of social and critical gerontology to highlight how these discourses in SIGCHI literature represent common stereotypes around old age that have also prevailed in the wider literature in gerontology. We conclude by proposing strategies for future research at the intersection of ageing and HCI.},

	abstract = {Background
Communication and empathy are considered as key competences in the care of persons with dementia. Virtual reality might be an effective intervention to train informal and professional caregivers of persons with dementia in order to improve their communication skills and empathy.
Objectives
The aim of this study was to map the use and impact of virtual reality simulation in dementia care education.
Method
A scoping review was performed. Studies with all types of qualitative or quantitative design published since 2007 in English, French or German were included if a virtual reality intervention was examined in a dementia care education setting (e.g. nursing school, caregiver training). The literature search was conducted in six databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, ERIC, and Inspec), including an additional hand search as well as backward and forward citation tracking of included studies. Charted data was narratively reported by clustering results according to study characteristics and impact of virtual reality.
Results
The review process resulted in the inclusion of six studies published between 2012 and 2017. Two of them are ongoing studies. Three studies had a one group pre-post-test design and in one study a post-test only design was applied. The samples consisted of caregivers of people with dementia as well as students and varied in size between seven and 126. Eight different outcomes were measured, e.g. empathy, competence, and stress. Interventions resulted in improvements of caregivers' and students' empathy and competences among other outcomes.
Conclusions
No studies with controlled design and group comparisons are available yet. There are some indications that virtual reality might be an effective intervention to train caregivers of persons with dementia. Little is known about the use and impact of virtual reality in dementia-related education. Since studies are rare and do not address effectiveness, the findings of this review can substantially contribute to guide further research on this topic.},

The COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for healthcare innovation across the globe. In tandem, it has brought travel restrictions and social distancing measures which act as significant barriers to traditional methods of innovation. In this context, we explore the use of virtual hackathons to generate innovation during a global pandemic.

Hackathons are events which bring people from different disciplines together with the aim of solving predefined challenges through iterative innovation.1 As the name suggests, this concept emerged from computer sciences, and the model has since been adapted and used in healthcare settings.2 In healthcare hackathons, clinicians collaborate with computer scientists, engineers, physicists, biochemical scientists, industry representatives and patients to solve unmet clinical needs.3 In education, hackathons have been used to facilitate collaborative learning and promote diversity in innovative thinking.4 Hackathons are typically conducted via a large conference format and small group working over a period of hours or a small number of days.

The MedTech Foundation is a national, interdisciplinary collaborative group that connects members from medicine and engineering to other MedTech-related specialties. The group has Hubs in six universities across the UK. These each deliver an annual educational workshop series called the …},

This paper presents an iteration of a participatory design process to create spaces for re-imagining products, services, systems, and policies that support breastfeeding in the United States. Our work contributes to a growing literature around making hackathons more inclusive and accessible, designing participatory processes that center marginalized voices, and incorporating systems- and relationship-based approaches to problem solving. By presenting an honest assessment of the successes and shortcomings of the first iteration of a hackathon, we explain how we re-structured the second "Make the Breast Pump Not Suck" hackathon in service of equity and systems design. Key to our re-imagining of conventional innovation structures is a focus on experience design, where joy and play serve as key strategies to help people and institutions build relationships across lines of difference. We conclude with a discussion of design principles applicable not only to designers of events, but to social movement researchers and HCI scholars trying to address oppression through the design of technologies and socio-technical systems.},

We present results from a multiple-case study that suggest the way that hackathon-style collocation advances technical work varies across technical domain, community structure, and expertise of participants. Building social ties, in contrast, seems relatively constant across hackathons. Results from different hackathon team formation strategies suggest a tradeoff between advancing technical work and building social ties.

In this paper, we sought to understand how civic data hackathons could generate impactful data analytics for NPOs' data-driven work, and how to support collaborative data analytics during hackathons. We collected various types of data (observations, surveys, and interviews) from two civic data hackathons with 9 NPOs and over 300 data volunteers in a Midwestern city in the U.S. Our results describe the collaboration activities and the types of actionable collaborative analytics outputs generated from these activities. We also identify a unique social group (i.e., client teams), who help with preparing and coordinating the event, perform brokering activities to support the collaborative analytics through the civic data hackathons. This broker role is vital for the success of the collaboration between domain experts and data experts. Our findings contribute to the CSCW research on the collaborative work of interdisciplinary hackathons, and to a broader understanding of civic data collaborations.},

Furthermore, most research around hackathons focuses on collegiate or civic events. Research around hackathons internal to tech companies, which are nearly ubiquitous, and present significant organizational, cultural, and managerial challenges, remains scarce. In this paper we address this gap by presenting findings from a case study of five teams which participated in a large scale corporate hackathon. Most team members voiced their intentions to continue the projects their worked on during the hackathon, but those whose projects did get continued were characterized by meticulous preparation, a focus on executing a shared vision during the hackathon, extended dissemination activities afterwards and a fit to existing product lines. Such teams were led by individuals who perceived the hackathon as an opportunity to bring their idea to life and advance their careers, and who recruited teams who had a strong interest in the idea and in learning the skills necessary to contribute efficiently. Our analysis also revealed that individual team members perceived hackathon participation to have positive effects on their career parts, networks and skill development.},

	abstract = {This article examines the outcomes of open innovation (OI) and their contribution to public value by analysing 19 subnational civic hackathons across the US. Our analysis identifies three outcomes (digital prototypes, public engagement and relationship building, and government awareness of open data and OI) and lends support to the predominance of public engagement and relationship building over digital prototypes. Further, our study shows that OI initiatives may contribute to public value by enhancing substantive outcomes, democratic accountability, and procedural legitimacy. However, such contribution is constrained by the early stage of adoption of these initiatives and by the limited participation of external actors.},

	abstract = {Hackathons – quick prototyping events to create technical innovations for perceived challenges – have become an important means to foster innovation, entrepreneurship and the start-up economy in smart cities. Typically such events are organized by companies working in partnership with city administrations, and are predominately attended by technically literate participants who work in the tech sector. In this paper, we consider and critique the rationalities and practices of commercially-oriented hackathons. Drawing on Gabriel Tarde and recent re-engagement of his ideas, we analyse the spatiotemporal practices that modulate the passion and imitation in and around hackathons. We document how hackathon schedules and spaces are arranged in ways to extend but also exploit participants’ passions for digital innovation and entrepreneurship, act as sites of upskilling and career progression, but also reproduce neoliberal and entrepreneurial labour and urban development. We argue that hackathons interpellate by attracting participants to desire and believe in entrepreneurial life and technocratic rationality to the effect of furthering the precarity of work and life and intensifying the corporatisation of cities. As such, hackathons reinforce the neoliberal underpinnings and ethos of entrepreneurial and smart urbanism.},

The hackathon was piloted as part of an ‘Introduction to Global Health’ undergraduate course in order to enable students to gain and create knowledge about specific global health-related challenges and, simultaneously, to acquire tangible and transferable skills. We provide a critical evaluation of our practice by drawing on relevant academic literature concerned with IBL, course material to describe the hackathon and its related components and outputs, and student evaluations to reflect on the overall module experience. We conclude by sharing reflections and recommendations of necessary measures required to institutionalize IBL in a more sustainable manner in higher education institutions.},

This plurality in TA is often not recognised by editors, reviewers or authors, who promote ‘coding reliability measures’ as universal requirements of quality TA. Focusing particularly on our reflexive TA approach, we discuss quality in TA with reference to ten common problems we have identified in published TA research that cites or claims to follow our guidance. Many of the common problems are underpinned by an assumption of homogeneity in TA. We end by outlining guidelines for reviewers and editors – in the form of twenty critical questions – to support them in promoting high(er) standards in TA research, and more deliberative and reflexive engagement with TA as method and practice.},

	abstract = {An estimated 47 million people worldwide are living with dementia in 2015, and this number is projected to triple by 2050. In the absence of a disease-modifying treatment or cure, reducing the risk of developing dementia takes on added importance. In 2014, the World Dementia Council (WDC) requested the Alzheimer's Association evaluate and report on the state of the evidence on modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia. This report is a summary of the Association's evaluation, which was presented at the October 2014 WDC meeting. The Association believes there is sufficient evidence to support the link between several modifiable risk factors and a reduced risk for cognitive decline, and sufficient evidence to suggest that some modifiable risk factors may be associated with reduced risk of dementia. Specifically, the Association believes there is sufficiently strong evidence, from a population-based perspective, to conclude that regular physical activity and management of cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, obesity, smoking, and hypertension) reduce the risk of cognitive decline and may reduce the risk of dementia. The Association also believes there is sufficiently strong evidence to conclude that a healthy diet and lifelong learning/cognitive training may also reduce the risk of cognitive decline.},

	abstract = {the worldwide number of dementia cases is increasing, and this is a trend that is expected to continue as a growing proportion of the population ages. However, conducting research with persons suffering from dementia can be fraught due to fears surrounding research risks in vulnerable populations. This can make seeking approval for studies difficult. As research directly involving persons with dementia is key for the development of evidence-based best practice, the development of a coherent ethical strategy to perform such research feasibly and effectively is of paramount importance.this paper aims to review and synthesise ethical challenges in performing research with persons who have dementia.in undertaking a systematic review of the current research literature, we will identify the central issues and arguments characterising research that concerns the ethical dimensions of research participation in the dementia population. Data were analysed using both inductive and deductive content analysis. Ethical considerations in research involving persons with dementia primarily concern the representation of the interests of the person with dementia and protection of their vulnerabilities and rights.a total of 2,894 results were returned from initial searches, following deduplication. In total, 2,458 were excluded at title review, and following abstract review 158 papers remained; 29 papers were included for analysis after full paper review and data extraction. Papers ranged between 1995 and 2013.this review has highlighted a lack of consensus in current research and guidelines addressing these concerns; a clear stance on ethical governance of studies is important for future research and best evidence-based practice in dementia.},

The data are video-recordings of 16 couples talking with a third party. The analysis focuses on the negotiation of epistemic rights, more precisely how partners initiate repair and correct claims made by the PWD on matters belonging to the latter’s epistemic domain. We identified three main practices for correcting the PWD: (1) correcting the statement, thereby claiming epistemic authority for oneself and denying it to the PWD, (2) inviting the PWD to self-correct, thereby attributing some epistemic authority to the PWD, and (3) disagreeing and providing reasons for one’s alternative claim, establishing a more symmetric epistemic gradient. The PWDs responses to the corrections displayed different degrees of acceptance, ranging from self-denigration to resistance and insistence.},

disorder that interferes with activities of daily living, relationships and

to provide comprehensive care for these patients and their families.
High-quality clinical practice guidelines can improve the quality and
consistency of care in all aspects of dementia diagnosis and management by
clarifying interventions supported by sound evidence and by alerting clinicians
to interventions without proven benefit.Objective: we aimed to offer a synthesis of existing practice
recommendations for the diagnosis and management of dementia, based upon
moderate-to-high quality dementia guidelines.Methods: we performed a systematic search in EMBASE and MEDLINE as
well as the grey literature for guidelines produced between 2008 and 2013.Results: thirty-nine retrieved practice guidelines were included for
quality appraisal by the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation II
(AGREE-II) tool, performed by two independent reviewers. From the 12
moderate-to-high quality guidelines included, specific practice recommendations
for the diagnosis and/or management of any aspect of dementia were extracted for
comparison based upon the level of evidence and strength of recommendation.Conclusion: there was a general agreement between guidelines for
many practice recommendations. However, direct comparisons between guidelines
were challenging due to variations in grading schemes.},
